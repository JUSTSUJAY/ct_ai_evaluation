Even though me and my friend  was wake at 5.00am but  during travelling in  bus me and my friend face a standing issuse in that rush and there is a traffic issue because of all this issuse we  was reaching the collage at 9.30am . Because of  reaching collage late me and my friend was getting scold from  watchman, principal ,hod, class teacher. 

 
2)Think about it;
     
             I was thinking about the problem during the class  time , playing , travelling ,studying  and i also told this issues to my friend he also said that receive a same sleepless problem . Me and my friend thinking that to join in hostel or stay in pg near the collage or to stay in relatives home or to buy a bike.

3) Plan a solution;
             
              We thinking that hostel is best because if we will come in bike there will be a traffic and charges for fuel .If we will stay in pg  there will be same problem. If will stay in relatives home there will be some misundering issuse.So, hostel is best.

4)Carry out the plan; 
          
              Finally, me and my friend vacated the pg and joined in the hostel it was happy to live there with our classmates.

            Train trasportation

Define the problem:
             Train transport plays a major role in Indian. Which is more afforadable and less time consuming transport comparinig to other vechicle. By this we know that how much imporatance does it have.But in india the transportation is not well maintained.In general coach there is no proper seats and over floating of peoples in general coach may  suffocate some childrens.Toilets are not neat and clean. 

Think about the problem:
             In this over floating peoples many old ege peoples are affecting and  childrens getting suffacate.So its makes people who hate the train transport.but in all this sutations the ticket fare is same(general coach) for all who is sitting comfortable and standing in the over crowd.

Plan a solution:
 1.Assinghing proper servents to clean restrooms.
2. appoint educated peoples to evaluate tickets.
3. limited the no of pepoles travel in general coach.
4. Increases train rates.
5. maintaining the utensils neatly.
6. providing stirct rules.
7. Teaching pepoles about the consequences.

Carry ot the plan:
    Assign person with well knowledged and who works with their dectication.Appoint ticket evaluater with several level of interviews with good communication skills.Allocate tickets only for avilable seats.
mainly in general coach allow limited peoples in a train which makes the passanger feel comfortable.
To make this happen goverments needs to increses the trains and make a time chart properly. Taxes that collected pfrom people should be used for people like this way to manage public transports and maintaining goverment properties.first thing rules and regulations must be followed by peoples properly.
or else if any one voilating the rules punishment will be given to them.And teaching peoples why the rules and regulations policies are desingned and purpose and importance of it.in concern it is not achieved by goverment without people without people coordination. people should help goverment to make by keep things neatly.

These roads also tend to cause accidents and even cause long duration of traffic jams, which maybe very tough for the workers in the community to go to work. This results in people not following the traffic rules, which may cause fights or discomfort in the roads to drive by.

We can solve this by taking the problem deeper and understanding the process of it.

Firsly, Developing the problem's base solution. People of the community should form a group in which people can share their respective opinions. Through this process they can come up with solution of the problem such as raising a request to the society's muncipal coorporation.

Secondly, Assessing the same to the coorporation for which they should find the solution by taking some roads to clean or build at one time that is for a week or so, so that they don't disturb the peace in the neighbourhood or cause disturbance in the society.

Identify the Issue: First, clearly describe the road-related issue you want to highlight. Is it potholes, uneven surfaces, lack of maintenance, or something else?

Location Details: Mention the specific location where the problem exists. Provide landmarks or nearby areas to help the authorities pinpoint the issue.

Safety Concerns: Explain how the poor road condition impacts safety. For instance, accidents, inconvenience, or damage to vehicles.

Request Action: Politely request prompt action for repair or improvement. Emphasize the urgency of the situation.

Assure Quality: Ask for assurance that any repair work will be of high quality and carried out by experienced workers.

Community Participation: Encourage community participation in road design, construction, and maintenance. Local involvement often leads to better outcomes.

Challeneges faced:


Limited Resources: Municipalities often struggle with limited budgets for road maintenance and upgrades.

Technical Inexperience: Constituency roads committees may lack technical expertise, affecting decision-making and project execution.

Conflict of Interest: Balancing the interests of various groups (e.g., commuters, businesses, residents) can be challenging.
Supervision Capacity: Ensuring proper supervision during construction and maintenance is crucial.
Transition to Devolved Structures: Changes in governance structures (e.g., devolution of powers) can impact road development.
Social Inclusion: Creating spaces for marginalized groups (women, elderly, people with disabilities) in decision-making is essential.Finally, The coorporation must execute the problem as soon as possible because roads needs to be used by the people and they cannot be kept in the state of construction for long.

By solving this problem people not only use the roads but keep the roads clean from the waste, follow proper traffic rules, avoiding traffic jams, avoiding accidents, workers can reach their respective workplace on time, avoid unneccesary fights, keeping the society peaceful.",10,,"The description of the problem lacks specific details and clarity.

### Introduction
Waste management is a critical issue that affects the health, environment, and overall well-being of a community. Inadequate waste management can lead to a host of problems, including pollution, disease, and the degradation of natural resources. This essay will outline a comprehensive plan to investigate and address poor waste management in a community using the Problem-Solving Method. This method involves several steps: identifying the problem, gathering information, generating potential solutions, evaluating and selecting the best solution, implementing the solution, and monitoring and reviewing the results.
##

### Identifying the Problem
The first step in addressing poor waste management is to clearly define the problem. In many communities, waste management issues can manifest in various ways, such as overflowing garbage bins, illegal dumping, lack of recycling facilities, and inefficient waste collection services. To accurately identify the problem, it is essential to engage with community members, conduct surveys, and observe the current waste management practices.
##

#### Engaging with the Community
Engaging with the community involves organizing meetings, focus groups, and interviews with residents, local business owners, and municipal officials. These discussions will help to gather firsthand information about the perceived waste management issues and their impact on daily life.
##

#### Conducting Surveys
Surveys can be distributed to a larger segment of the community to gather quantitative data on waste management practices, frequency of waste collection, levels of recycling, and satisfaction with existing services. Surveys can be conducted online, in person, or through mail.
##

#### Observing Current Practices
Observing the current waste management practices involves site visits to waste collection points, landfills, and recycling facilities. This will provide a clear picture of the operational efficiency and areas that need improvement.
##

### Gathering Information
Once the problem is identified, the next step is to gather detailed information to understand the root causes and extent of the issue. This involves analyzing the data collected from community engagement, surveys, and observations, as well as reviewing relevant literature and case studies from other communities with similar issues.
##

#### Community Acceptance
Community acceptance is crucial for the successful implementation of any solution. Engaging with community members to gather their input and feedback on the proposed solutions will help to identify the most acceptable and supported options.

### Implementing the Solution
Once the best solution is selected, the next step is to develop an implementation plan. This involves outlining the steps required to put the solution into action, assigning responsibilities, setting timelines, and securing the necessary resources.

#### Developing an Implementation Plan
The implementation plan should include a detailed timeline, clearly defined roles and responsibilities, and a budget. It should also outline the specific actions required to implement the solution, such as purchasing equipment, hiring staff, and conducting training sessions.

#### Securing Resources
Securing the necessary resources involves obtaining funding, acquiring technology, and recruiting personnel. This may require applying for grants, seeking sponsorships, or partnering with local businesses and organizations.

#### Conducting Training
Training is essential to ensure that all stakeholders are equipped with the knowledge and skills required to implement the solution effectively. This includes training for waste management personnel, community volunteers, and residents.

### Monitoring and Reviewing the Results
The final step in the problem-solving process is to monitor and review the results of the implemented solution. This involves setting up a monitoring system to track progress, collecting data on the impact of the solution, and making adjustments as needed.

#### Setting Up a Monitoring System
A monitoring system should be established to track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as waste collection efficiency, recycling rates, and community satisfaction. This system should include regular data collection and reporting mechanisms.

#### Collecting Data
Data on the impact of the solution should be collected through surveys, observations, and records from waste management services. This data will help to assess the effectiveness of the solution and identify areas for improvement.

#### Making Adjustments
Based on the data collected, adjustments may be needed to optimize the solution. This may involve refining operational processes, increasing community engagement efforts, or implementing additional technological innovations.

Enhance Specificity: Provide additional information regarding the impact of the uncleanliness of the parks, and focus on the consequences in more detail. For instance, talk about possible health hazards, children and teenagers staying indoor most of their times, higher tendencies of crimes in poorly maintained parks. 
Impact on Various Groups: Explain how the unclean parks particularly impact certain population, including children, elderly persons, and those with pet animals. 

2. Data Collection: 
Broaden Sources: Other source of data to be considered as part of the sources other than surveys, community feedback and park inspection include health department data, environmental data or even record data whereby there usage of technologies like the drones or sensors to capture the park at different points in time. 

3. Plan Development: 

Specificity of Waste Management Strategies: Build upon plans of action from other well-taken care parks. In the Review of Current Knowledge section, it can present other waste management systems, types of the bin used and/or successful community engagement campaigns that practice has put in place. 

Community Involvement: Include methods to involve park users in maintaining the park or promoting such matters as a clean-up event, or awareness creation, and volunteers. 

4. Execution:

    Transportation is a quite of a problem in our community which 
    is public  transportation.So,following the IDEA Model I will
     get to the step-by-step solution .which will be my suggestion.

    
        STEP 1: IDENTIFYING THE PROBLEM 
        
    When it comes to identifying the problem, the problem i feel 
    our community is having is inadequate public transportion.
    because i have seen people and even myself struggling to 
    to find the public transportation when its needed.because i
    live in the outskirts of bengaluru for education.and i know ,
    how people are struggling to find a proper transportation.
    because the only public transportation we find there is the 
    government buses but without proper timings and in less 
    frequency.


    STEP 2 : DEVELOPING THE SOLUTION  

    So,now as we have already identified the problem which is 
    inadequate public transportation.  under which, we have 
    identified that the buses are in less frequency and without 
    proper timings.
        
    one approach to solve the improper timing of the buses .
     we can install GPS trackers in every buses and develop 
    an app for the public which can track each an every
    information including the schedule of the bus.
    and install digital boards in every bus stops which 
    includes the information of the buses.so that people will 
    aware of the scheduling of the buses.

     one approach to solve the frequency of the buses is to 
    encourage the government to increase the funding 
    towards the public transportation and increase the the 
    frequency of the buses.

    STEP 3: IMPLEMENTING THE SOLUTION

    So,now as we came up with the solution which is installing
    the GPS trackers and building an app for the public so that 
    they are aware of the scheduling of the buses .and  also 
    encourage government to increase the funding towards the 
    public trasportation to increase the frequency  of the buses 
    so that it will be easy for the public to use the buses at their
    convenience.
    
    implementing all these solutions for the convenience of the 
    public .and test these solutions .


    STEP 4: ASSESSING THE IMPLEMENTATIONS 

      So,once the implementations are done the job is not yet 
    done .we have assess the implementations .
    
    By going through each and every thing which has been     
    implemented and analyse and compare the situations 
    before and after implementing the solutions which we came
    up with.and we should even take the insights from the 
    public about how it is helping them and what all improvements 
    are necessary .

This involves encouraging residents and businesses to reduce waste generation, reuse materials, and recycle a wide range of materials like paper, plastic, glass, and metals.
Expanding organic waste composting initiatives. Diverting organic waste like food scraps and yard trimmings from landfills through large-scale composting can significantly reduce methane emissions and produce valuable soil amendments.
Upgrading waste collection and transportation infrastructure. Investing in modern, efficient waste collection vehicles and optimizing routing can improve the logistics and environmental impact of waste management.
Developing advanced waste processing and disposal facilities. This includes building state-of-the-art landfills with robust methane capture systems, as well as waste-to-energy incineration plants that can recover energy from non-recyclable waste.
Promoting extended producer responsibility (EPR) policies. EPR shifts the responsibility for end-of-life product management to manufacturers, providing incentives to design products that are easier to recycle or reuse.
Improving public education and stakeholder engagement. Raising awareness about waste reduction, recycling, and proper disposal methods can empower citizens and businesses to participate in sustainable waste management.
Strengthening waste management regulations and enforcement. Clear policies, targets, and monitoring mechanisms can drive more effective and environmentally sound waste management practices.
Implementing a combination of these solutions tailored to local conditions can help communities transition towards a more circular and sustainable waste management system.",10,,Assignment is plagiarised.,0,100.0,6

","1.**over- reacting for a long day**

After a stressful day at work filled with meetings and deadlines, I returned home feeling mentally exhausted. Despite having planned a healthy dinner, I found myself reaching for snacks instead. The decision to indulge in chips and ice cream was driven by my depleted willpower. I had spent the day resisting distractions and making tough choices, leaving me with little energy to stick to my healthy eating plan. This led to regret later as I realized I had consumed far more calories than intended.

2. **Impulsive Online Shopping**

After a week of strict budgeting and resisting unnecessary purchases, I felt mentally fatigued. On a Friday evening, I browsed online stores and stumbled upon a sale. My depleted self-control made it easy to justify buying several items I didn’t need. I told myself it was a reward for my hard work throughout the week. The next day, I regretted the impulse purchases, realizing that I had spent money that could have been better allocated to savings or essentials.

 3. **Neglecting Exercise**

During a particularly busy week filled with work and personal commitments, I found my motivation to exercise waning. Each morning, I planned to go for a run, but by the time evening rolled around, I felt mentally drained. Instead of lacing up my sneakers, I chose to binge-watch a show. My ego depletion left me unable to muster the willpower to prioritize my health. This decision not only affected my physical fitness but also contributed to feelings of guilt and disappointment in myself.

4. **Reacting Emotionally in Conflicts**

In a heated discussion with a friend, I felt my patience wearing thin after a long day of managing stressful tasks. Instead of calmly expressing my feelings, I let my emotions take over and responded with sarcasm and defensiveness. My ego depletion from the day’s challenges had diminished my ability to engage in constructive dialogue. This poor decision led to an escalation of the conflict and hurt feelings, which could have been avoided with a more measured response.

 5. **Procrastinating on Important Tasks**

As deadlines approached for a significant project, I found myself overwhelmed and mentally fatigued. Instead of focusing on the tasks at hand, I succumbed to distractions like social media and video games. My depleted self-control made it difficult to resist the temptation to procrastinate. This poor decision resulted in a last-minute rush to complete the project, leading to subpar work and increased stress. I recognized that if I had managed my energy and time better, I could have produced a higher-quality outcome.

--



1.**Appeal to Authority Fallacy**
**Argument**: ""My uncle, who is a mechanic, says that eating carrots improves your eyesight. Therefore, if you want to see better, you should eat more carrots.""

**Flaw**: This argument relies on the authority of the uncle being a mechanic rather than an expert in nutrition or eye health. Just because someone is knowledgeable in one field does not mean they are knowledgeable in another. The claim lacks scientific evidence and is not backed by credible research.

 2. **Hasty Generalization**

**Argument**: ""I met two people from that city, and they were both rude. Therefore, everyone from that city must be rude.""

**Flaw**: This argument makes a broad generalization based on an insufficient sample size. Meeting only two individuals does not provide enough evidence to conclude that an entire population shares the same trait. It ignores the diversity of behaviors and personalities within any group.

3. **Slippery Slope Fallacy**

**Argument**: ""If we allow students to redo tests, soon they will expect to redo every assignment, and eventually, they will think they don’t have to do any work at all.""

**Flaw**: This argument assumes that allowing one specific action (redoing tests) will inevitably lead to extreme consequences (not doing any work at all) without providing evidence for this chain reaction. It exaggerates the potential outcomes and ignores the possibility of setting reasonable limits on test retakes.

 4. **Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc Fallacy**

**Argument**: ""Ever since I started wearing my lucky socks, my fvorite sports team has been winning. Therefore, my lucky socks are the reason for their success.""

**Flaw**: This argument assumes a causal relationship between two events (wearing lucky socks and the team's success) based solely on their chronological order. It ignores other factors that could contribute to the team's performance, such as training, strategy, or the skills of the players.

 5. **False Dilemma Fallacy**

**Argument**: ""You either support the new policy at work, or you don’t care about improving our company. There’s no middle ground.""

**Flaw**: This argument presents a false dichotomy by suggesting that there are only two options when, in reality, there may be multiple perspectives or alternatives. It oversimplifies a complex issue and disregards the possibility that someone might have valid concerns about the policy while still wanting to improve the company.

1.**""Vaccines cause autism.""** This claim gained traction in the early 2000s, despite being debunked by numerous studies. The message appealed to cognitive ease by leveraging the emotional fear of parents regarding their children's health, simplifying complex medical information into a digestible narrative that fit existing anxieties about vaccines.

2.**""Climate change is a hoax.""** Promoted by various politicians and public figures, this statement plays on cognitive ease by framing climate change as a conspiracy, which is easier for some to accept than the complex scientific realities. This narrative resonates with individuals who prefer simple explanations that align with their political beliefs, thereby reducing cognitive dissonance.


3.**""The economy is better than ever.""** Politicians often use selective statistics to create a narrative of economic prosperity, despite underlying issues like income inequality. This message appeals to cognitive ease by presenting a straightforward, optimistic view that aligns with the desire for positive news, simplifying the multifaceted nature of economic data.

4.**""Eating fat makes you fat.""** This widely accepted belief, rooted in outdated dietary guidelines, oversimplifies the complex relationship between diet and health. It appeals to cognitive ease by providing a clear-cut rule that is easy to remember and follow, despite more recent evidence suggesting that the type of fat consumed is more important than the quantity.


5.**""Crime rates are skyrocketing.""** This claim has been used by various political figures to justify stricter law enforcement measures. It appeals to cognitive ease by invoking a visceral fear of crime, often ignoring statistical evidence showing that crime rates have generally decreased. The emotional response to perceived danger simplifies the complex realities of crime trends.

","Exercise #1:

1. Late Night Craving:
After a long day of attending classes, studying, and participating in coding practice, I often find myself indulging in unhealthy snacks late at night. Despite my intention to maintain a healthy diet, the depletion of my mental energy leads me to give in to these cravings.

2. Procrastination on Assignments:
There have been times when I delayed starting assignments or studying for exams because my mental energy was drained from other tasks. This procrastination resulted in rushed work and lower quality performance.

3. Impulsive Online Shopping:
After a mentally exhausting day, I sometimes engage in impulsive online shopping, purchasing items that I don't really need. This is a clear example of ego depletion affecting my decision-making, as I fail to exercise self-control over my spending habits.

4. Unreasonable Health Issues:
I have a habit of taking stress over little things. This stress leads me to overthinking which in returns leads to health issues like fever. This stress comes from my ego clashes with my own opinions.

5. Skipping Workouts:
Despite knowing the benefits of regular exercise, I sometimes skip my workouts after a mentally demanding day. The lack of mental energy to motivate myself results in inconsistent exercise routines, affecting my overall fitness.

Exercise #4: 

1. All students are required to take exams. Some students are athletes. Therefore, some athletes do not take exams.
This is flawed because being an athlete does not exempt a student from taking exams.
All cats are mammals. 

2. Some mammals are pets. Therefore, some cats are not pets.This is flawed because it does not logically follow that some cats are not pets just because some mammals are pets.
All humans need oxygen to live.

3. Some living things are plants. Therefore, some plants do not need oxygen.This is flawed because the statement does not provide any information about plants' need for oxygen.

4. All books are sources of knowledge. Some sources of knowledge are digital. Therefore, some books are not digital.
This is flawed because it does not logically follow that some books are not digital just because some sources of knowledge are digital.

5. All birds can fly. Some animals can swim. Therefore, some birds cannot swim.This is flawed because the ability to fly does not exclude the ability to swim.

Exercise #5:

1. ""Made from natural ingredients"":
Many food brands use this message to convince people their products are healthier, even if they contain processed elements. The simplicity and positivity of ""natural"" make it easy to accept.

2. ""99.9% germ-free"":
 Hand sanitizers and cleaning products often use this message. The specific, bold number appears credible and is easy to remember, creating trust in the product's effectiveness.

3. ""Clinically proven"":
Skincare and health supplement brands use this phrase. The term ""clinically"" adds a sense of scientific validation, making it more believable without the consumer checking the actual studies.

4. ""Money-back guarantee"":
This message is commonly used in advertising to reduce perceived risk. The promise of a refund makes the decision to purchase seem safer and more straightforward.

5. ""New and improved formula"":
Many consumer products use this phrase to suggest enhanced quality. The simplicity and positivity of ""new and improved"" create an easy, favorable impression, even if the improvements are minor or unnoticeable.
These messages leverage Cognitive Ease by using clear, positive, and memorable language, often with specific numbers or phrases that sound authoritative and trustworthy.",15,"The answer demonstrates a strong understanding of ego depletion and its effects, providing detailed and relevant scenarios from their own life.

There are many scenarios in my life where I have taken poor decisions due to the Ego depletion effect.
some of them are:
1)I had a doubt in a subject and i don't wanna clarify that with my friend due to ego issues so i haven't studied it and i gone to exam hall so i got that questioned and i was not able to answer this is one of the poor decision i made because of ego depletion effect.
2)One day i have gone to the supermarket to buy groceries with that i wanted to buy a chocolate box and the cost of the box was  INR530 and then i have done with my biling and i asked to pay INR535 so iasked billing person about the cost and they said this is the cost because of my ego depletion i have gone out of the shop without taking that box and i searched many shops for that box and i didn't got that and i was exhausted about my self.This another scenario where i have took wrong decision due to my Ego.
3)One day me and my dad were talking about a issue and when he shouted at me and asked me to change myself for others
i have just walked away from there because i was anger.Another day when i faced the situation which my father asked me to change i went to him and apologized him for yelling at him on that day.This is another scenario where i took a poor decision.
4)I'm a throwball player and i was asked to be the captian for the team and i said i'm interested and they gave me my vice-captian.Vice-captian is who i dont like to talk and i quit from it because of my ego depletion effect and i lost the opportunity.
5)I had a fight with one of my closed one and i haven't spoke to them and didn't had anything for 2 days and i got fainted  i faced a health issue that took me to the lowest phase i have faced ever ignored my food and tablets and i got severe headache and stomachache because of my ego.

1)""Boost is secrete of my energy-Boost""
Cognitive Ease:They tell that boost is secrete of my energy if one drinks the boost thy will get more energy.As human brain prefers easy decisions.They make it in a visualization video and they make people believe it and promote their brands.But the purpose of boost is for the flavour.
2)""Taller, stronger, sharper-Horlicks""
Cognitive Ease:They promote itas if the one drinks the horlicks it will make them taller,sharper and stronger.It is the tagline of them to make the human prefer their brand more so that their product will be in a good position.People won't think efficiently they prefer easy decisions by seeing their promotions.Horlicks doesnt add much colour but it gives taste for milk.
3)“Taste the rainbow-Skittles”
Cognitive Ease:Skittles promt their tagline by saying TASTE THE RAINBOW.That make a sense for children brain to get attract to the tagline and the rainbow colours attract the person more.But the candies are with all the food coulours which are not good for health.Each brand have their own taglines to make people prefer their brand.
4)“Open Happiness” – Coca-Cola
Cognitive Ease:Coca-cola repersents their tagline by saying that ""OPENS HAPPINESS"" to attract people.And their bottle and the drink colours make people attactive and the chemical formula which they use iks very unique and also they make people attactive by their promotions.People choose these drinks by the coulou taste and attractive.They make easy descicions without thinking.But they have lot of unwanted things or chemicals which make us unhealthy.
5)“Eat Fresh-Subway”
Cognitive Ease:Subway tagline is 'EAT FRESH'.They attract the people by their tagline and also making the order infront of the customer which attracts them more than many others but they make it with bread and vegies where the stock is already present.",15,,"The response lacks clarity and coherence in some parts, making it difficult to follow the examples provided in Exercise #1.

",15,"The student has provided some relevant examples in Exercise 1 that demonstrate ego depletion, such as 'Indiscipline in following diet' and 'Not sticking to time table (Procrastination)'. These examples are valid and show an understanding of the concept. Additionally, in Exercise 5, the student correctly identifies some messages that appeal to cognitive ease, such as 'Cosmetic brands which promise highly fantasized transitions' and 'Many false promises of doing better for the poor by politicians during elections'.","The student did not provide any response for Exercise 4, which significantly impacts the overall score. Additionally, some examples in Exercise 1 are vague and lack detail, such as 'Sign up for something at the moment not thinking of consequences' and 'Deviating from own path following what others are doing'.

","Problem #1:

1. When i was in school, i had an assignment with a deadline to complete by next day. But i was so exhausted and bored to even bother about finishing my work. Instead , I started binge watching my favorite movies all the day and then slept that night. Next day when I went to school, everyone had already completed the assignment while i got imposition due to my laziness and poor mindset.
2. After a long and stressful day, i came home feeling  mentally exhausted. I felt like i could'nt even move an inch. After seeing junk foods on my fridge, i could'nt resist myself and gave in even though i have been following a strict diet for over a month while going for gym. This made me gain extra calories and then took me more than a week to become fit again.
3. One night before exam, i was so scared and nervous as i did'nt prepare anything. I was sure that i was going to fail as i spent my whole playing video games with my friends. I was so distracted that I even i am having an exam tomorrow. The next week results came , and i utterly failed because of my negligence towards studies.
4. After a stressful day, I was driving my car in main highways. I was corssing the speed limit.

Problem#4:

1. All birds has wings to fly, insects also has wings, So some birds are also insects. This assumption is absolutely flawed some birds cannot be insects.
2. Scientists are intelligent, some artists are also smart and intelligent, So some scientists are also artists. This flawed and we cannot say this with certainity.
3. All athletes are fit people, some fit people are vegans and eat only veggies, So some athletes also be vegans and eat only veggies. This is flawed and it makes no sense to assume it this way.
4. All humans have lungs, some creatures like reptiles also has lungs, So some humans are also reptiles. This is a classic example of how far 
can flawed arguments can go.
5. All planets orbits the sun, some planets orbit the sun has rings, Hence some planets have rings. This is flawed because not all planets 
has rings around them.

Problem#5:
1. Tobacco industries promoted cigarettes as being healthy, even when told unhealthy by doctors. These advertisements played on a sophisticated image of smoking. By repeatedly associating cigarettes with health and sophistication, the tobacco companies created a familiar and comforting mindset for customers that many accepted, despite growing evidence of the dangers of smoking.
2. Earlier it was believed that the ""Earth is flat"" which some believed that we are living in a flat world and then many scientists did experiments and proved that it is a wrong belief and even faced percutions for not complying with their religious beliefs.
3. Many cool drink companies promote that their drink is ""Made with 100% natural fruits"" which actually have in a minimal level and has lot 
of preservatives and sweetners to enhance the taste and improve the taste of that drink. Most of them belive that it is true even though it is harmful.
4. Drinking 8 glasses of water every day makes you healthier this is a popular phrase used by doctors and other people but this is 
incorrect because the amount of water which we have to drink everyday depends on our weight, the place we reside and the intensity of our daily work. if we are working outside in a hot environment we need to have more water to make yourself hydrated. Based on our situation and the environment we live in, this condition may vary.
5. During the COVID-19 pandemic, misinformation about vaccines was spread by several public figures, including former President Donald Trump. The idea of a simple, existing drug as a cure was highly controversial and easy to grasp. The message was repeated across various media channels, creating familiarity and comfort with the info. In a time of fear and uncertainty, people preferred the for an easy solution over the complex and evolving scientific understanding of the virus and its treatment. The repetition and simplicity of the message made it seem credible, despite the lack of scientific evidence supporting it.

The Brain's Predictive Nature and the Rubber Hand Illusion :
The rubber hand illusion is a amazing perceptual psychological phenomenon where a person can experience a sense of ownership over a fake hand if it is placed in a specific position and synchronized with the stimuli to their real hand.This illusion makes brain's to temporary ownership and adopt to the rubber hand.In this illusion while your vision is focused on the rubber hand the stimuli is sent to the brai from the real hand .In this case your brain will try to allign both the impulses from eyes and the hand .
The brain's predictive nature plays a crucial role in this illusion. 
Here's how:

Predictive : 
The brain constantly makes predictions about the environment around us based on past experiences and current sensory input. It uses these predictions to interpret incoming electric impulses and identify different object.

Sensory Integration: 
When a person experiences the rubber hand illusion, the brain receives different sensory information: visual input from the rubber hand and tickle input from the real hand.
Prediction Error: 

If the visual and tickle  inputs align, the brain's predictions are confirmed, it is taing the sense of ownership over the rubber hand. However, if there is a variation, the brain tries to align with the variation in information.

Neuroplasticity: 

The brain is highly plastic, meaning it can adapt and change in response to experience. Over time, repeated exposure to the illusion can lead to a stronger sense of ownership over the rubber hand, as the brain adjusts its predictions to accommodate the new sensory information.
In essence, the rubber hand illusion demonstrates how the brain's predictive nature and plasticity work together to create a predicting sense of self. By understanding these mechanisms, we can gain valuable insights into the neural basis of consciousness, perception, and body representation.

Exercise#2:

 A Useful Example of the Brain's Predictive Nature: Rapid Object Recognition
One of the most beneficial aspects of the brain's predictive nature is its ability to rapidly recognize objects in the environment. This is essential for survival, as it allows us to quickly identify potential threats or opportunities.
How it works:
Past Experience: The brain stores a vast amount of visual information about objects from past experiences.
Prediction: When we encounter a new object, the brain immediately starts making predictions about its identity based on its visual features (shape, color, texture, etc.).
Confirmation: If the visual features match those of a previously stored object, the brain quickly confirms the identification. This process happens so rapidly that we often don't consciously notice it.
Example: Imagine walking through a forest. As soon as you see a snake, your brain immediately recognizes it as a potential threat. This rapid recognition allows you to react quickly and avoid danger.
A Limitation of the Brain's Predictive Nature: Perceptual Illusions While the brain's predictive nature is generally beneficial, it can also lead to perceptual illusions. These illusions occur when the brain's predictions are incorrect or misleading.
Example: The Müller-Lyer illusion is a classic example. In this illusion, two lines of equal length appear to be different lengths due to the presence of arrowheads at their ends. The brain's prediction, based on past experiences with depth perception, leads it to believe that the line with outward-pointing arrowheads is longer. However, when measured, both lines are found to be the same length.
This limitation highlights the importance of critical thinking and questioning our perceptions. While our brains are incredibly adept at making predictions, it's essential to be aware of their potential biases and limitations.",10,,,7,50.0,6

Rubber Hand Illusion: — The Rubber hand illusion is a psychological and neuroscientific experiment that attempts to demonstrate the ability of brain in creating body ownership by integrating disseminated sensory information. The experiment, first used by Botvinick and Cohen in 1998, has a person sit with one hand hidden from view while an actualistic rubber is positioned[] visible to the front of them. A brush strokes both the real, hidden hand and the rubbery prop. The experience quickly leads most subjects to believe and ""feel"" that the rubber hand is even their own.

This is an optical illusion because brain gives priority to visual and tactile feedback rather than proprioceptive signals (the sense of position your body has in space). If input in one form (seeing the rubber hand being stroked) is paired with sensory modalities from another domain, like touch or proprioception as occurs when subjects also feel their own unseen hand being touched at more-or-less the same time and place on which they are staringly fixated. The brain deals with that integrated multisensory signal by defaulting to integrating them into a single representation of what it presumably should be expecting - i.e., concluding there's but one body part before us where two might have otherwise quite reasonably been unitarily residing all along. In fact, the effect is so potent that subjects may respond defensively to threats against the rubber hand-like a sharp object coming at it.

This highlights the depth of potential body perception changes and neuroplasticity. This demonstrates just how malleable our body schema is and how basic sensory manipulations can alter the way we perceived it. This has potential applications in prosthetics — helping users gain a greater sense of ownership over their robot limbs can increase how well the limb is used and lead to higher user satisfaction. This is also applicable in the realm of Virtual Reality and teleoperation systems, where immersive experiences can benefit from a feeling of presence (or embodiment)in virtual avatars or remote devices.

The concept of the Rubber Hand Illusion continues to be a touchstone for studies that delves deeper into understanding its constraint and neural basis. Other manifestations of the illusion with different body parts and sensory modalities have been demonstrated in various studies, highlighting yet again the incredible ability our brains possess to seamlessly synthesize information across sensory inputs.


### EXERCISE 2

### Use Case: Faster Feeling and Responding

One of the many ways in which our brains being so predictive is beneficial lies in quick perception and action. The brain never stops predicting what will happen next based on previous experience in the torrents of sensory input. As an example, when playing a game like tennis by the time ball arrives your mind has already predicted its path given parameters like speed, angle and previous experiences. In doing so, it can make quick and accurate predictions about the trajectory of balls heading its way within a few tenths of seconds before they land on ground to help put players at the right place with enough time to adapt their moves for good hits. Take away this prediction machine, and every time a sensation comes in we would have to think about what it means by comparing the new data with historical norms before reacting — causing us to move […] much slower and often [moving] less coordinated.

### Limitation:Bias and Stereotypes!!

But this dependence on predictions also means that the brain will only show us what we want to see, unconsciously buttressing our perceptual blind spots and prejudices. Because the brain wants to rest on familiar patterns and things it has learned, research points out that new information or anything that contradicts existing beliefs can be either ignored or incorrectly interpreted. You can see these at play in social interactions where stereotypes are used to make assumptions about people. This means that when someone conforms to a stereotype this cane be thinked and triggered by the brain focusing on stereotypical details, while ignoring other information. It probably triggered some biased judgements making it harder for us to perceive people as they are actual and maintaining a limited view that closely align with unsafe generalizations.

So imagine the same scenario, by reproducing what you learned it allows us to improve how we interact with our environment thanks to a brain that is predictive and anticipates probable situations. The same mechanism, however, can also trap our perception and understanding in return so that it is difficult to break out of this ingrained path even if the new experience might be novel or unexpected.",10,The answer demonstrates a clear conceptual understanding of the rubber hand illusion experiment and its connection to the predictive nature of the brain.

The experiment, first used by Botvinick and Cohen in 1998, has a person sit with one hand hidden from view while an actualistic rubber is positioned[] visible to the front of them. A brush strokes both the real, hidden hand and the rubbery prop. The experience quickly leads most subjects to believe and ""feel"" that the rubber hand is even their own.

This is an optical illusion because brain gives priority to visual and tactile feedback rather than proprioceptive signals (the sense of position your body has in space). If input in one form (seeing the rubber hand being stroked) is paired with sensory modalities from another domain, like touch or proprioception as occurs when subjects also feel their own unseen hand being touched at more-or-less the same time and place on which they are staringly fixated. The brain deals with that integrated multisensory signal by defaulting to integrating them into a single representation of what it presumably should be expecting - i.e., concluding there's but one body part before us where two might have otherwise quite reasonably been unitarily residing all along. In fact, the effect is so potent that subjects may respond defensively to threats against the rubber hand-like a sharp object coming at it.

This highlights the depth of potential body perception changes and neuroplasticity. This demonstrates just how malleable our body schema is and how basic sensory manipulations can alter the way we perceived it. This has potential applications in prosthetics — helping users gain a greater sense of ownership over their robot limbs can increase how well the limb is used and lead to higher user satisfaction. This is also applicable in the realm of Virtual Reality and teleoperation systems, where immersive experiences can benefit from a feeling of presence (or embodiment)in virtual avatars or remote devices.

The concept of the Rubber Hand Illusion continues to be a touchstone for studies that delves deeper into understanding its constraint and neural basis. Other manifestations of the illusion with different body parts and sensory modalities have been demonstrated in various studies, highlighting yet again the incredible ability our brains possess to seamlessly synthesize information across sensory inputs.

### EXERCISE 2

### Use Case: Faster Feeling and Responding

One of the many ways in which our brains being so predictive is beneficial lies in quick perception and action. The brain never stops predicting what will happen next based on previous experience in the torrents of sensory input. As an example, when playing a game like tennis by the time ball arrives your mind has already predicted its path given parameters like speed, angle and previous experiences. In doing so, it can make quick and accurate predictions about the trajectory of balls heading its way within a few tenths of seconds before they land on ground to help put players at the right place with enough time to adapt their moves for good hits. Take away this prediction machine, and every time a sensation comes in we would have to think about what it means by comparing the new data with historical norms before reacting — causing us to move […] much slower and often [moving] less coordinated.

### Limitation:Bias and Stereotypes!!

But this dependence on predictions also means that the brain will only show us what we want to see, unconsciously buttressing our perceptual blind spots and prejudices. Because the brain wants to rest on familiar patterns and things it has learned, research points out that new information or anything that contradicts existing beliefs can be either ignored or incorrectly interpreted. You can see these at play in social interactions where stereotypes are used to make assumptions about people. This means that when someone conforms to a stereotype this cane be thinked and triggered by the brain focusing on stereotypical details, while ignoring other information. It probably triggered some biased judgements making it harder for us to perceive people as they are actual and maintaining a limited view that closely align with unsafe generalizations.

So imagine the same scenario, by reproducing what you learned it allows us to improve how we interact with our environment thanks to a brain that is predictive and anticipates probable situations. The same mechanism, however, can also trap our perception and understanding in return so that it is difficult to break out of this ingrained path even if the new experience might be novel or unexpected.",10,,,10,100.0,8

This is basically an image of the predictive processing of the brain to enable the efficient perception and action of the brain through the formation of expectations of what is likely to happen .

As is intuitive, the brain predicts to afford rapid action under urgencies of time when circumstances call for it. For example, if you are driving and an automobile in front of you makes a sudden stop, you will immediately apply the brakes. This other-executor of action using the predictive power of the brain need not even consciously analyze the situational pitfalls.

The rubber hand illusion is a fascinating psychological phenomenon where a person can experience a sense of ownership over a fake hand if it is placed in a specific position and synchronized with tactile stimuli to their real hand. This illusion highlights the brain's remarkable ability to integrate sensory information and create a coherent representation of the body.
The brain's predictive nature plays a crucial role in this illusion. Here's how:
Predictive Coding: The brain constantly makes predictions about the world based on past experiences and current sensory input. It uses these predictions to interpret incoming sensory data and identify discrepancies.
Prediction Error: If the visual and tactile inputs align, the brain's predictions are confirmed, reinforcing the sense of ownership over the rubber hand. However, if there is a discrepancy, the brain tries to reconcile the conflicting information.
Plasticity: The brain is highly plastic, meaning it can adapt and change in response to experience. Over time, repeated exposure to the illusion can lead to a stronger sense of ownership over the rubber hand, as the brain adjusts its predictions to accommodate the new sensory information.
In essence, the rubber hand illusion demonstrates how the brain's predictive nature and plasticity work together to create a coherent sense of self. By understanding these mechanisms, we can gain valuable insights into the neural basis of consciousness, perception, and body representation.

EXERCISE 2)  A Useful Example of the Brain's Predictive Nature: Rapid Object Recognition
One of the most beneficial aspects of the brain's predictive nature is its ability to rapidly recognize objects in the environment. This is essential for survival, as it allows us to quickly identify potential threats or opportunities.
How it works:
Past Experience: The brain stores a vast amount of visual information about objects from past experiences.
Prediction: When we encounter a new object, the brain immediately starts making predictions about its identity based on its visual features (shape, color, texture, etc.).
Example  : Imagine walking through a forest. As soon as you see a snake, your brain immediately recognizes it as a potential threat. This rapid recognition allows you to react quickly and avoid danger.
A Limitation of the Brain's Predictive Nature: Perceptual Illusions While the brain's predictive nature is generally beneficial, it can also lead to perceptual illusions. These illusions occur when the brain's predictions are incorrect or misleading.
Example: The Müller-Lyer illusion is a classic example. In this illusion, two lines of equal length appear to be different lengths due to the presence of arrowheads at their ends. The brain's prediction, based on past experiences with depth perception, leads it to believe that the line with outward-pointing arrowheads is longer. However, when measured, both lines are found to be the same length.
This limitation highlights the importance of critical thinking and questioning our perceptions. While our brains are incredibly adept at making predictions, it's essential to be aware of their potential biases and limitations.",10,,This assignment has been found to be plagiarized.

The Rubber Hand Illusion and Brain Predictions the brain continuosly generates the prediction based on past experiences.
 In this experiment, participants see a rubber hand being touched while their real hand, which is hidden from view, is touched simultaneously.
.The brain easily gets to the rubber hand and  anticipates that the sensations it experiences match those being applied to the visible rubber hand.
.this means that the brain can access visual and tactile information so effectively because it start to accept the rubber hand is part of our body.  This experiment highlights how the brain’s ability to predict and integrate sensory inputs can significantly alter our perception of body ownership and self. 
It reveals that how our brain's predictive mechanisms can reshape our sense of body perception through sensory information.

**Exercise 2**

The brain’s ability to predict what will happen next plays in daily activities such as driving.while driving the brain concentrate on the movements of other vehicles,pedestrains, buildins and traffic signals.For ex., if you see a car brake applied, our brain predicts that the car wil slow down or stop the car. This prediction helps you react in navigating the environment and react in  advance by preparing change the lanes or slow downto get over take the car.
it will avoid the acciddents and we can move on fast as possible.

In the another situation, the brains predictive nature can also lead to the ones worldview social interations.when you met any guy who i knows that i have negaative experience , my brain might unconsciously apply past judgments .For sudden, if the new person resembles someone you didn’t get along with before, you might unfairly assume they will be difficult to interact with him.This predictive mechanism can lead to a narrow perspective, This happens because your brain uses familiar patterns to make quick judgments, where i might judge  the guy i know based on the previous one,which can lead to inaccurate and unfair evaluations.Identifying this tendency can help you avoid letting past experiences unfairly influence your view of the person.In both driving and socially things, the brain’s predictive nature shapes our responses—quick, reflexive reactions in driving , shaping how we deal with everyday situations.

Why Modern Animation is Bad
1. Authority:

•Author : The author of the article is Oliver Brainfield. To research his authority, I looked into his background. Oliver Brainfield has been a renowned media critic, well-seasoned in analyzing and critiquing film and animation. He has written for various entertainment blogs and sometimes writes for larger multi-media publications.

•Credentials : Brainfield has a degree in Media Studies, which gives him critical insight into mordern media trends and theories . His Continuous involvement in this field and writing for multiple platforms says it all about his credibility.

•Potential Bias: Brainfield tends to be an opposing critic. He tends to have strong opinions agianst the modern media. That might imply from his statements that he may come off a little biased against older animations compared to newer ones in his works.

2. Accuracy :

•Facts and Claims : Indeed, the article has presented a number of claims regarding modern animation, like the visible decline in quality due to over-reliance on CGI and focusing more on profitability over artistry. Brainfield states numerous examples of the animation quality in some popular modern animated films versus older classics.

•Sources : Brainfield indeed refers to numerous examples of animation and interviews from animators, but throughout the work, he does not indicate sources for particular facts. The general lack of direct quotation makes it difficult to verify some of presented arguements, which is already influencing the overall accuracy.

•Errors : No factual errors were immediately apparent, but the lack of citations raises several questions about some of the information Brainfield presents.

3. Objectivity :

•Bias and Tone : This article is completely biased against modern animation; in fact, the author continously compares it unfavorably with traditional animation. Brainfield emplys that modern animation is ""soulless"" or ""formulaic,"" which tends to point out that a personal bias existas. His arguments are thus basically opinionated with some evidence supporting his presented arguments emplying they are not balanced.

•Images and Graphics : The images included in the paper from modern and classic animations develops a mindset of his claims further. However, the images chosen only supports his negative view of modern animation since, one way or another, this proves to be less objective.

4. Currency :

•Publication Date : The publication year of the article is 2023. which is fairly recent, therefore the latest trends in animation could have been well considered.

•Relevance : The discussion of modern animation versus traditional is very relevant to today's media issues. Yet, this article does not provide us with the latest developments in animation technology or to the recent blockbusters of animation, which may show how limited the degree of its current validity is.

•Updates : There is no mention of subsequent updates to the article, which is needed as new developments come about in the animation industry rapidly.

5. Coverage :

•Depth of Topic : The article by Brainfield discusses his point of view regarding modern animation. From the technological, storytelling, and market influences, all these aspects provide a wide scope of his argument.

•Scope : While the article indeed a wide scope on animation in general, it does not evenly balance out both sides of its argument. It lacks discussion points from the perspective of those who believeing modern animation and a proper insight from active animators.

•External References: This article neither has a bibliography nor references, and it does not even provide any links to external sources that would guide the readers to further readings on the respected subject. The absence of such means limiting the possibility of the reader to formulate his/her own opinion also not being able to engage in the subject more deeply.Why Modern Animation is Bad

","Priming is a process in psychology that is used to alter consumer behavior in terms of perceptions and choice in marketing and advertising. Here are five examples from business and advertising:



1. *Supermarket Layouts*



   - *Priming Mechanism:* A placement of fresh produce or bakery at the entrance of a supermarket may create a good first impression due to the colorful display of fruits and vegetables and the smell of freshly baked goods.



- *Effect:* This type of priming can activate positive attitudes toward the shop and may even force customers to buy more. This kind of attractive presentation of healthy foods can further unconsciously influence shoppers' decisions while choosing healthier products later in their shopping trip.



2. *Luxury Brand Placement*

   - *Priming Mechanism:* High-end brands are usually placed at eye level on the shelves in a shop or otherwise in central places within the shop.

- *Effect:* This position sets the consumer to start linking luxury with quality and exclusivity. Consumers, after exposure to such brands, will be much more likely to perceive them as better or worthy of premium price tags when less expensive options are available.

3. *Time-Limited Offers*
   - *Priming Mechanism:* The advertisements majorly focus on flash sales or limited-time offers with a countdown timer.
- *Effect:* These offers activate the pressure of urgency to trigger faster purchase decisions in consumers. The FOMO binds them to act and not delay the purchase, mostly leading to impulsive buying.

4. *Social Proof in Reviews*
   - *Priming Mechanism*: The online retailers and restaurants highlight their customers' given reviews and ratings, more so the high ratings and positive comments.
• Effect: This social proof is priming the potential buyers to be more confident in one's purchasing decision, for if others have experienced something good with the product, then likely them too. It can also influence them towards choosing higher-rated products or services.

5. *Store Ambient Music*
- *Priming Mechanism:* A great number of shops are always playing ambient music in categories that relate to the brand image of a shop, like fast-paced songs in a cloth store and calm music in high-end shops, thus modulating their customers' emotions.
• Effect: The kind of music will get the shoppers in the right mood and perception of the store. Fast music triggers energy among shoppers, and thus a shopper might have a willingness to spend more time passing through the selling store or shop with the hope of buying more. Calm music is used in high-end stores to set a business or selling atmosphere of calmness, thus the shopper will be in a better position to buy at high prices.

","Priming, and is therefore better elucidated as a psychic effect in which consciousness retains some knowledge of stimuli that subsequently activate responses to other ones or even influence decisions subsequent to them. With that being said, here are five very different examples from wildly divergent corners that successfully demonstrate just how versatile and varied approaches that priming can take in the worlds of advertising and business, detailing not only exactly what it is and how it works but also covering some of the conducted effects that have taken place:


1. **Luxury Branding and Pricing:**
The prices to be paid for even certain lines of products, and especially the more expensive and well-known brands, are, without a doubt, many orders of magnitudes higher when placed in juxtaposition with the prices that less prestigious and lower-profile brands request for products that are inherently similar.
Priming How it Works: A high price attached to a product serves to easily prime consumers to form exclusivity and high-quality associations in their minds.


**Effect**: Thus, they would tend to link a luxury brand to much higher appeal and high social status, while in reality, the quality difference may be small or practically not there. That, in turn, would lead to this specific brand being perceived and registered as being of far higher value and carried with it a feeling of richness, for which they achieve people to actively recommend purchases decided by the urge to state social standing and prestige.


2. **Making Healthier Choices at the Grocery Store:**
This fact can be clearly observed in grocery stores where the healthier foods are mostly placed at the eye level of customers so that shoppers may easily notice them, find them, and buy them. The opposing fact to this is that the less healthy ones are set a bit higher or lower, thus a customer will have to reach up or bend down in order to pick them, which will make them more likely to be passed or ignored.







**Implementation Priming**: The fact that a person more often finds himself exposed to healthier food options promoted at eye level in grocery stores, which is an evident act of priming, has always predisposed him or her to first seek and try those items when selecting what to buy.
Effect: The more healthy food choices a consumer can envision and access conveniently, the likelier they are to reach out for healthy alternatives. The healthier choices available are thus installing in the minds of people a preference for them because they always seem easy to reach, mainly because they are around and easy to notice in exposed places.

3. **Free Samples and Discounts:**
The many retail stores normally offer free samples of a product their customer is considering to purchase, or in the alternative, the retail stores through this method offer significant discounts on the very first purchase made by a new customer.
Prima Application: Free samples, coming hand in hand with price reduction, prime the customers to perceive the product as well within their reach, not being as expensive as it might have seemed initially; having this perception on the positive side, the customers are triggered into action and encouraged to seize the opportunity.

**Effect:**
It's likely they will actually buy because the consumer thinks they're getting an excellent deal, or the chance to experience something with no downside. This might result in not only immediate sales but long-term brand loyalty-in other words, perhaps a guarantee that the customer will be retained.

4. **Celebrity Endorsements:**

 • **Instance**: Brands rely heavily on numerous celebrities for promoting them and extending their association in brand advertisements. How it's Applied: When a product is associated with a well-liked and popular celebrity, just the fact of the association may determine consumer attitudes. Just because a product comes from such a high-profiled figure, people might instinctively start assuming it has to be highly desirable in quality. This effect of the celebrity can let them view the product as not only popular but superior and effectively prime potential buyers to think of the product in good terms based on a celebrity's reputation and charm.

**Effect:** Even with the most basic usage of the product, consumers can be led to feel that their social status or their personal image, in some significant way, has been uplifted. It follows from this that the motivation to purchase the product is even further enhanced since they are attempting to emulate or adopt the lifestyle of the celebrity in their personal lives. 


5.  **Social proof in Reviews and Testimonials:**


Example: Online retailers make sure to show customer reviews and testimonies for products. • Priming: Positive reviews and high ratings act as influential factors in priming potential buyers to offer an added layer of assurance for this product to be of quality and reliable enough.

 **Effect**: This form of social proof effectively validates a buyer's intentions and encourages them to have a greater trust in the product, especially when they see that others have confirmed to have had a positive experience with it, which in turn significantly increases the likelihood of conversion by reducing perceived risks and enhancing the credibility associated with the product. The examples above, considered now, are full of small yet important hints and suggestions on how to enormously change consumer behavior. These might be encouragements to adapt to healthier nutrition, help more within an available budget, or achieve more reassurance and confidence from positive feedback.

","# 5  Examples of priming by advertisiments/buisnesses are:
1.  Using a celebrity to do the advertisment. It impacts both ways depending upon the image that celebrity hold in the industry. For example if the celebrity is really in high demand right now or is in trending due to his/her new movie/series or they hold a really good image in the industry thn there are more higher chances that people will prefer that product only due to the fan following and the mainly bexause of the image that celebrity holds, it impacts the sales highly. For example most of the beauty industry use Angelina Joulie because of her beauty and image to advertise thier product.
2. Using a deadline. Using deadlines creates an urgency or panic in the customer and a sense that the adversised thing is being sold out at a high level and people are prefering it more. It creates the urgency that we need to buy or do it as soon as possible as it is ending. For example schools and colleges use during the time of thier admissions.
3.   Using the 'First impression is the last impression' method. Most of the buisensses like beauty or food give out thier samplings as best as possible to create thier good impression in front of customers so that they would buy thier product only no matter if the product is that much good or not after actually buying but they will say only good towards the product. For example Jio company used this method when they just launched thier sim.
4. Packaging. Most of the luxury brands has the best packing systems, it makes the customers feel the riches and luxury within them a sense of power and achive. For example the packaging of beauty products of dior is authentic and rich compared to other beauty brands.
5. Reliablity. It plays a major role in companies reputation and if reliablity is good then it increases the sales of the comapany at a good level. For example Apple is know best for it's quality and reliablity.

","Priming in advertising and business involves subtly influencing people’s decisions and behaviors by exposing them to certain stimuli or cues. Here are five examples of how priming might be used in your environment:

1.) Supermarket Shelf Placement:

How Priming is Used: Products are strategically placed at eye level or at the end of aisles to increase their visibility. High-margin items, like premium brands or new releases, are often positioned where shoppers are more likely to see them first.

Effect: You might be more inclined to purchase these items simply because they are more visible and accessible. The convenience and prominence can prime you to view these products as more desirable or necessary.

2.) Fast Food Value Menus:

How Priming is Used: Fast food restaurants often feature value menu items prominently, with large, bold text and colorful visuals. They might also include comparisons showing the savings you get when buying a value meal versus purchasing items individually. Effect: The emphasis on savings and value can prime you to perceive these deals as a better choice, leading you to spend more on what seems like a better bargain, even if you didn't originally plan to buy those items. Limited-Time Offers:

How Priming is Used: Advertisements and in-store promotions often highlight limited-time offers or “while supplies last” sales. The sense of urgency is created by countdown timers or messages about the limited availability.

Effect: This creates a psychological pressure to make a purchase quickly to avoid missing out. The fear of missing a good deal can prime you to make a purchase sooner than you might have otherwise.

3.) Celebrity Endorsements:

How Priming is Used: Brands use celebrities to endorse their products, featuring these endorsements prominently in ads. The celebrities’ popularity and appeal are used to create positive associations with the product.

Effect: You might be more inclined to buy the product because the celebrity’s image primes you to associate the product with positive qualities like success, attractiveness, or reliability.

4.) Social Proof in Online Reviews:

How Priming is Used: E-commerce sites often display reviews, ratings, and the number of purchases or people currently viewing the product. Some also show “most popular” or “best seller” tags.

Effect: Seeing high ratings and positive reviews can prime you to believe the product is of high quality and desirable. The social proof influences you to make a purchase, as you may feel reassured by the consensus of other consumers.

In each case, priming works by subtly influencing your perception and decision-making, often without you being fully aware of the impact these cues have on your choices

","Priming in business and advertising involves subtly influencing consumers' decisions through cues that trigger certain behaviors or attitudes. Here are five examples of priming that are commonly used:



### 1. **Color Schemes in Fast-Food Restaurants**

   - **Priming Technique**: Fast-food chains often use warm colors like red, yellow, and orange in their logos, interiors, and packaging.

   - **Effect**: These colors are known to stimulate appetite and create a sense of urgency, encouraging customers to order more food and eat quickly. This leads to higher turnover rates and increased sales.



### 2. **Music in Retail Stores**

   - **Priming Technique**: Retail stores play specific types of music depending on the time of day or the type of product being sold. For example, slow-paced music is often played in high-end stores.

   - **Effect**: Slow music encourages customers to spend more time browsing, which can lead to more purchases. In contrast, upbeat music in a grocery store might make you move faster, filling your cart more quickly.

### 3. **Product Placement on Shelves**
   - **Priming Technique**: Supermarkets place high-margin items at eye level on shelves and cheaper or store-brand products on lower shelves.
   - **Effect**: By placing more expensive or profitable items at eye level, customers are more likely to notice and choose them, leading to higher sales of those products.

### 4. **Luxury Branding in Advertisements**
   - **Priming Technique**: Ads for luxury products often feature elegant, high-status environments, like a penthouse or a private jet, to prime viewers with the idea of exclusivity and success.
   - **Effect**: This priming makes viewers associate the product with luxury and status, increasing their willingness to pay a premium for the product, even if the actual product experience doesn’t justify the high cost.

### 5. **“Limited Time Offer” Labels**
   - **Priming Technique**: Marketers use phrases like ""limited time offer"" or ""only a few left"" to create a sense of scarcity and urgency.
   - **Effect**: This primes customers to think that they might miss out on a deal if they don’t act quickly, pushing them to make a purchase decision faster, often without fully considering their need or budget.

Each of these examples shows how businesses use subtle cues to influence customer behavior, often leading to increased sales or higher profit margins.",5,,Originality is missing. ,0,100.0,5

","Certainly! Priming in advertising and business often involves subtle cues that influence your decisions and behaviors without you necessarily realizing it. Here are five examples:

1- Grocery Store Layout and Placement

Priming Used: Grocery stores often place high-margin items like candy and snacks at eye level or near checkout counters.

Effect: This layout primes you to notice and potentially purchase these items. The convenience and visibility make you more likely to add them to your cart, increasing impulse buys.

2- Loyalty Programs with Points

Priming Used: Many retailers offer loyalty programs where you earn points or rewards with each purchase.

Effect: The visible accumulation of points or rewards primes you to spend more to reach the next reward threshold. The idea of getting something ""free"" or at a discount can make you more likely to choose that store over others.

3- Limited-Time Offers

Priming Used: Advertisements and in-store promotions frequently feature phrases like ""limited-time offer"" or ""while supplies last.""

Effect: This creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, priming you to make a purchase decision quickly to avoid missing out. The fear of missing out (FOMO) can push you to buy more hastily.

4-Color Schemes in Branding

Priming Used: Brands use specific colors in their logos and packaging to evoke certain emotions. For instance, blue can create a sense of trust and security, while red can stimulate excitement and urgency.

Effect: The color scheme primes your emotional response to the brand, which can affect your perception of the product's value or reliability and influence your buying decision.

5- Celebrity Endorsements

Priming Used: Companies use celebrities or influencers to endorse their products.

Effect: Seeing a familiar or admired figure using a product can prime you to associate the product with their positive qualities. This endorsement can make you more inclined to purchase the product, as you might believe it will bring similar benefits or prestige.
In each of these examples, priming works by subtly influencing your decisions and perceptions through cues that affect your behavior without direct pressure.

1. Fast Food Restaurants and Red
Priming Technique: The use of the color red.
Effect: Red is often associated with urgency, excitement, and appetite. Fast food chains frequently use red in their branding and decor to subconsciously stimulate these feelings in customers, encouraging them to eat faster and order more.
2. Luxury Brands and Classical Music
Priming Technique: Playing classical music in stores or advertisements.
Effect: Classical music is often associated with sophistication, elegance, and high-class tastes. Luxury brands use this to elevate their products and create a sense of exclusivity, making customers more likely to associate their brand with luxury and desire their products.
3. Grocery Stores and the Placement of Items
Priming Technique: The strategic placement of items in the store.
Effect: Grocery stores often place essential items like milk and bread towards the back of the store, forcing customers to walk through aisles filled with other products. This increases the likelihood of impulse purchases as customers encounter items they might not have planned to buy.
4. Online Shopping and Countdown Timers
Priming Technique: Using countdown timers for limited-time offers or sales.
Effect: Countdown timers create a sense of urgency and scarcity, motivating customers to make a purchase quickly before the offer expires. This can lead to impulsive buying decisions even if the customer might not have originally intended to make a purchase.
5. Restaurants and Free Bread
Priming Technique: Offering complimentary bread or appetizers before the main meal.
Effect: Free food can make customers feel more satisfied and generous. This can lead to them ordering more expensive items or tipping more generously, as they feel a sense of obligation to reciprocate the kindness.

### Examples of Priming in Business and Advertising



**1. In-Store Music and Product Choices**



- **Example:** A grocery store plays relaxing, classical music in the background.

- **How Priming is Used:** The soothing music primes shoppers to feel calm and leisurely.

- **Effect:** Shoppers are more likely to spend more time in the store, browse more items, and make additional purchases. The atmosphere created by the music encourages consumers to make more spontaneous buying decisions without feeling rushed.

**2. Social Media Ads Targeting**

- **Example:** You frequently engage with posts about fitness on social media. Soon, you start seeing ads for workout gear and supplements.
- **How Priming is Used:** The ads are tailored based on your previous interactions with fitness-related content.
- **Effect:** Seeing these ads primes you to consider these products when making purchasing decisions, reinforcing the idea that they align with your interests and goals. This increases the likelihood of you making a purchase related to fitness.

**3. Color Schemes and Emotional Responses**

- **Example:** A fast-food restaurant uses red and yellow color schemes in their branding and decor.
- **How Priming is Used:** Red and yellow are known to stimulate appetite and create a sense of urgency.
- **Effect:** The color scheme primes customers to feel hungrier and more inclined to eat quickly, which can lead to increased sales. The colors also create a vibrant and energetic environment, encouraging quick decisions and repeat visits.

**4. Limited-Time Offers**

- **Example:** An online retailer displays a countdown timer for a special discount on their website.
- **How Priming is Used:** The countdown timer creates a sense of urgency by priming you with the idea that the offer is available only for a limited time.
- **Effect:** The urgency primes you to make a faster decision to purchase, often leading to impulse buys. It leverages the fear of missing out (FOMO), prompting immediate action to take advantage of the deal before it expires.

**5. Celebrity Endorsements**

- **Example:** A skincare brand features a well-known celebrity in their advertisements, showcasing their use of the product.
- **How Priming is Used:** The presence of a celebrity primes consumers to associate the product with success, beauty, and prestige.
- **Effect:** Consumers are more likely to trust and desire the product because they are primed to believe that using it will confer similar positive attributes. The celebrity endorsement subtly suggests that using the product is a pathway to achieving a desirable lifestyle or appearance.

Each of these examples demonstrates how priming can subtly influence decision-making by shaping perceptions and emotional responses in a way that aligns with business objectives. By leveraging these techniques, businesses can guide consumer behavior and increase the likelihood of desired actions.",5,,70% use of AI Re do ,0,100.0,5

","Grocery Store Layout:

Priming: The layout of grocery stores is strategized with all the necessities, like milk and bread, kept at the back. While you meander through the aisles to get to these, you are primed with other products.
Result: This layout primes you to make impulse purchases. By the time you get to the back for milk or bread, you have already seen, and been primed for, other products that will likely be added to your purchase.
Fast-Food Menu Design:

Priming: Menus from fast-food restaurants often show items in larger fonts or images, or they put them in boxes or with special colors.
Effect: This visual emphasis primes you to become aware and think of the items highlighted first. It often makes you order that featured meal or combo, which typically has higher margins for the restaurant.
Retail Sales Promotions:

Priming: Sales signs normally prominently displayed in stores or online, such as ""50% off"" or ""Buy One Get One Free"".
Effect: Such promotions can prime you to feel more value and urgency, which might lead to quicker purchase decisions, and increases the quantity bought beyond one's plans.
Product placement in movies and TV shows:

Priming: The brands paid to have their products placed in a movie/TV series, and then the characters used or referred to the products bought.
Effect: One associates products with positive characters or situations, which makes you think positive about the brands. It might increase your chances of selecting the product in a buying decision.
Celebrity Endorsements:

Priming: Advertisements featuring celebrities or influencers using a product may lead to an association of the product with the admirable traits of that celebrity.
It primes you to have positive thoughts about the product and links the product in your mind to the qualities you admire in the celebrity, increasing the likelihood that you are going to select or recommend a product based on positive association.

","1. Restaurant Menu Design
   - Example : High-end restaurants often place their most expensive dishes at the top or bottom of the menu.
   - Priming Mechanism: By positioning these dishes in prominent spots, diners are primed to think in terms of higher prices and may perceive other options as more reasonably priced.
   - Effect:: This can make diners more likely to choose a mid-priced option or feel better about the cost of their meal.

2. Supermarket Layout
   - Example: Supermarkets place essential items like milk and bread at the back of the store.
   - Priming Mechanism: Shoppers are primed to walk through the entire store to reach these items, increasing exposure to other products.
   - *Effect: This encourages impulse purchases as customers are exposed to additional items along the way.

3. Online Shopping:
   - Example: E-commerce sites use ""limited-time offers"" and countdown timers.
   - Priming Mechanism: The urgency created by these elements primes shoppers to make quicker decisions and feel pressured to buy before the deal expires.
   - Effect: This can lead to increased sales as customers rush to take advantage of perceived bargains.

4. Advertising with Celebrities:
   - Example: Ads featuring well-known celebrities using or endorsing a product.
   - Priming Mechanism: The association with a celebrity primes consumers to connect positive attributes of the celebrity with the product.
   - Effect: This can enhance the appeal of the product and influence consumers to make a purchase based on their admiration for the celebrity.

5. Car Dealership Promotions
   - Example: Car dealerships often highlight ""special financing rates"" or ""discounted prices"" prominently in their advertisements.
   - Priming Mechanism: These promotions prime buyers to focus on the financial benefits and perceive the deal as more attractive.
   - Effect: This can lead potential buyers to focus on the cost savings rather than other factors, influencing their decision to purchase.

Explain your research process and how you applied the 5-point framework (which consists Authority, Accuracy, Objectivity, Currency, and Coverage) to gauge the credibility of your sources. The more detailed your assignment is, the better. 

Please refer to the following guidelines to understand what you can discuss for each of the 5 criterions:

Authority: Who is the author of the source? What are the author's credentials, or, what qualifies the author to produce this content? What is the background and the history of the author? What are their potential biases? Are they known for letting opinions seep into their writing? (note that these are not the thinking biases/heuristics that we will study later. These biases have to do with their own opinion/background.)   

Accuracy: Are the facts presented as they actually are? Are the sources of the claims cited? Are the sources well trusted and reliable? Are all the arguments substantiated, or are they mostly opinions disguised as facts? Is the information free of errors?

1. Selecting Sources: I began by identifying credible sources of information about the Great Barrier Reef, focusing on a mix of academic articles, reputable news organizations, and official publications from authoritative institutions. 

2. Evaluating Sources Using the 5-Point Framework:

   Authority: I sought information from sources with established expertise in marine biology and environmental science. This includes peer-reviewed journals, official reports from organizations like the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA), and articles from reputable news outlets and scientific organizations.

  Accuracy: I checked the information for factual correctness by comparing multiple sources on the same topic. Sources that included citations and references to primary research were prioritized.

   Objectivity: I looked for sources that presented information in a balanced manner, avoiding those with a clear bias or agenda. This included contrasting viewpoints on controversial topics related to the reef, such as climate change impacts and conservation efforts.

   Currency: Given the dynamic nature of environmental issues, I focused on recent publications and reports to ensure the information was up-to-date. Older sources were cross-referenced to understand historical context but were not relied upon for current data.

   Coverage: I aimed to gather comprehensive information covering various aspects of the Great Barrier Reef, including its ecological significance, threats, conservation efforts, and scientific research.

Five Pieces of Information About the Great Barrier Reef:

1. Ecological Significance:
   The Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral reef system, stretching over 2,300 kilometers along the northeastern coast of Australia. It is home to an incredibly diverse range of marine life, including over 1,500 species of fish, 411 species of hard coral, and various marine mammals and reptiles. This biodiversity makes it a critical component of global marine ecosystems.

   Source: GBRMPA official website, peer-reviewed articles in marine biology journals.
   Evaluation: The GBRMPA website is an authoritative source with accurate, up-to-date information. Peer-reviewed journals provide detailed and precise scientific data.

2.Threats from Climate Change:
   Climate change poses a significant threat to the Great Barrier Reef through coral bleaching, caused by rising sea temperatures. Coral bleaching occurs when corals expel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues, leading to loss of color and essential nutrients, which can result in coral death.

   Source: Research articles from environmental science journals, reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
   Evaluation: Both sources are authoritative and accurate, providing detailed evidence of climate change impacts. Reports are current and cover recent studies.

3. Conservation Efforts:
   Various conservation programs are in place to protect the reef, including the Reef 2050 Long-Term Sustainability Plan, which aims to address key issues such as water quality, biodiversity, and climate change. The plan is a collaborative effort involving government, industry, and community groups.

   Source: GBRMPA reports, Australian government publications.
   Evaluation: These sources are current and objective, presenting a comprehensive view of ongoing conservation efforts.

4.Economic Impact:
   The Great Barrier Reef contributes significantly to Australia's economy, particularly through tourism. It is estimated that the reef generates billions of dollars annually from tourism-related activities, which supports local economies and creates jobs.

   Source: Economic impact studies from tourism research organizations, Australian Bureau of Statistics reports.
   Evaluation: These sources are authoritative and accurate, offering up-to-date economic data. They are objective and provide a full picture of the reef’s economic benefits.

5.Impact of Crown-of-Thorns Starfish:
   The Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) is a predator of coral that has caused significant damage to the Great Barrier Reef. Outbreaks of COTS have led to extensive coral loss, exacerbated by other stressors such as climate change and pollution.

   Source: Research articles on marine ecology, reports from marine conservation organizations.
   Evaluation: These sources are authoritative and accurate, providing detailed evidence of the ecological impact of COTS outbreaks. They are current and cover the scope of the issue.

Summary of Framework Application:

  Authority: I prioritized information from experts in marine science and official bodies like GBRMPA.
  Accuracy: Cross-referenced facts from multiple reputable sources.
  Objectivity: Chose sources that offered balanced views, avoiding those with clear biases.
  Currency: Selected recent publications and reports to ensure current relevance.
  Coverage: Gathered comprehensive data to cover various aspects of the Great Barrier Reef.",15,Very good attempt,,14,60.0,14

Explain your research process and how you applied the 5-point framework (which consists Authority, Accuracy, Objectivity, Currency, and Coverage) to gauge the credibility of your sources. The more detailed your assignment is, the better. 

Please refer to the following guidelines to understand what you can discuss for each of the 5 criterions:

Authority: Who is the author of the source? What are the author's credentials, or, what qualifies the author to produce this content? What is the background and the history of the author? What are their potential biases? Are they known for letting opinions seep into their writing? (note that these are not the thinking biases/heuristics that we will study later. These biases have to do with their own opinion/background.)   

Accuracy: Are the facts presented as they actually are? Are the sources of the claims cited? Are the sources well trusted and reliable? Are all the arguments substantiated, or are they mostly opinions disguised as facts? Is the information free of errors?  

Objectivity: Is the writer biased? How intense is the bias? Are graphics and images used to sway the opinion of the reader? Is the purpose of the writeup to change the opinion or is it to inform?  

Currency: How current or recent is the information? Is the date of updating mentioned? Is the date of when the information was gathered mentioned? Are recent developments being taken into account? Is it the latest information on the topic? When was the source last updated?  

Coverage: How much of the topic has the source covered? Is the scope of the topic clearly stated? Are there bibliography and reference sections? Are any external source links provided?

But if you look at the unemployment rates for 1901 and for 2017, they were almost the same. In the past 5 years, we'have actually been creating a alot of jobs, but not adding much to the GDP. People are workinh more but not producing very much, which is exactly the opposite of what you'd expect from AI. So maybe the robots aren't coming fast enough.

Credibility:- The established facts are seemingly, with claims being patched up against refernce to expert opinions, such as Jason furman, former chairmen of a white house council of economic advisors, and francesca rossi from IBM research. The arguments are based on history reference and expert testimonies, which evidently bring down the risk of presenting opinion as fact.

Objectivity :- The article forms ana even-grounded tone and focuses on informing over-inducing. Several perspectives on the impact of AI on jobs, Potential benifits, and risks. The text is not weaponized by visualization and very emotional language that tries quite overtly to form the readera position.

Currency :- This article is published in sept,2017 and, thus it may be generally considered to have been written in a very remote period, given the dynamic character of AI's development. IT reflects the state of knowledge and predictions of the time but does not take into account the much more recent developments.

Coverage:- The article is well covered and delves on the discussion about AI's effects on jobs towards its lenght, looking at varying aspects in terms of historical setting on the discussion , status as well as impact in the future.

1. Machine Learning: One of the categories of AI, machine learning is a process by which the program learns from the data produced and optimizes the results without being coded for that specific task. 
2. Natural Language Processing (NLP): Natural language processing is the special branch of AI that allows it to learn language and communicate through it; the uses include chatbots, translation, and sentiment analysis. 
3. AI in Healthcare: It serves in diagnostics, drug discovery and development, in creating/implementing individual treatment regimens that increase the efficacy and effectiveness of the healthcare processes. 
4.  Autonomous Systems: Automated Auto Mobiles, drones, and robots with AI have control over self-driving vehicles that continue to be under development for improving the safety and decision-making process. 
5. AI Governance: Currently there is growing debates towards developing policies for regulating machine learning and AI that will help in correcting biases and making their impacts clear to the public.
 
**Authority:**
 
The main sources I used for gathering information were: 
 An article from the MIT Technology Review containing arguments employed in the article by scientist, professor specializing in AI. 
 A book authored by Stuart Russell who is an academic in Artificial Intelligence and a professor of computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley. 
 Two publication sources - BBC and Wired are used as the sources of articles of the news The BBC is a reputable news source around the world, as well as Wired, an American magazine known for its elaborate editorial and fact-checking processes. 
 In all the cases I ensured I checked the profile of the authors to ensure that they were competent to write about artificial intelligence. For example, Stuart Russell has spent more than fifteen years researching this field, and the MIT Technology Review is a peer-reviewed science publication. 
 

**Accuracy:**
 
 The facts presented were well cited and sources published in peer reviewed journals were used. For instance, when the author was advancing the argument that artificial intelligence is relevant to health care, he or she was able to point to active projects, including IBM Watson Health. 
 Besides, I ensured that the data presented was consistent by cross-checking from different sources. For instance, the means of differentiation between Narrow AI and General AI was explained comprehensively in varying articles and the facts that were garnered were proved to be authentic. 
 I did not include sources that have biased opinion with no evidence to support them, for instance, some blog sites and forums. 
 

**Objectivity:**
 
 All the sources I used did not have overly positive or negative tone and all the facts were stated impartially. For instance, when discussing AI ethical issues, the concern was on making the audience understand the possible hazards and opportunities as opposed to presenting an opinion that they should adopt, believe or reject. 
 All the sources avoided the use of overly dramatic statements or graphics with a view of swaying the reader. In this case the aim of the information disclosed was not necessarily to persuade but more to provide the clients with updated facts. 
 

**Currency:**
 
 AI is a dynamic field and hence made sure that most of the sources I used were up to date. The research paper which was from the MIT Technology Review was published in 2023 and while using articles I used articles from within the last one year. 
 The information I also incorporated also included current trends in the development of AI and recent changes in the AI systems including the GPT-4 and self-driving systems. 


**Coverage:**

 The sources describe AI widely, including the definition, the application at the moment, and the further development. For instance, the book “Human Compatible” by Stuart Russell offers an extensive perspective of the technical function, as well as the different philosophical and ethical implications of having AI. 

 In each source, its application was clearly defined. For instance the MIT Technology Review article dwell more on the technological aspect while the book by Stuart Russell favours both technical and the ethical. 
 Almost all the sources included bibliographies and references that not only gave credibility to the information gathered, but cross check was also possible. 


Having solved the five-point credibility framework, I was confidently making conclusions that the information concerning AI is credible in these sources. The authors were expert and the facts given were neutral and credible, the information given here was timely and the sources given offered complete information regarding the subject matter. This approach of analyzing information can be used in any area of study in order to ensure that the information obtained is accurate and relevant.

**Topic: Chandrayaan 3 Mission **

 Five Pieces of Information 
 Objective and Mission Goals: Chandrayaan 3 was India’s lunar mission launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) on July 14, 2023 with the mission of attaining a soft landing process on the lunar surface. It was restricted to landing only, whereas its forerunner, Chandrayaan 2, had a soft landing failure but a success on the orbiter. 
 
 Launch and Landing Details: The mission was done using GSLV Mk III rocket and had an orbiter, lander named Vikram and a rover called Pragyan. Lander also landed safely on the moon on 23rd August 2023 and now India also joins that list of four countries who have successfully landed on the moon. 
 
 Scientific Instruments: Chandrayaan 3 included several essential payloads such as ‘Seismic Experiment Package for Lunar Exploration’ to monitor lunar seismic activity and ‘Thermal Infrared Spectrometer’ to measure temperature of lunar surface. They are useful in the interpretation of objectives of studying lunar geology as well as the seismic conditions. 
 
 Success and Achievements: Chandrayaan 3 successfully landing is a success story for ISRO; the agency has proven its ability to undertake big flights, also advancing India to be a key participant in the lunar exploration. 
 
 Future Implications: The success of the mission should serve future lunar exploration and manned flights. It also enhances the strength of the country in space science, and even opens the doors to more associations and relationships with other countries.

 What is CRISPR? 
 
 CRISPR is an atomic gene-slicing technology, originally identified in bacteria and widely described by the acronym for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats. It performs as a pair of molecular scissors to cleave and also edit DNA. 
 Who Developed It? 
 
 Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier developed CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system in year 2012. They built on this by employing this bacterial system in a variety of organisms including man. 

 Medical Applications: 
 
 Some of the diseases that have possible treatments are genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anemia. Another kind of genetic manipulation is already being tested in ongoing clinical trials – its capacity to repair mutations in patient cells. 

 Ethical Concerns: 
 
 The technology bring some ethics issues emerging when genes in embryos are edited and altering the future generations. Some are as follows; More so, there are concern over side effects and future repercussion. 

 Regulatory Status: 
 
 Regulations vary globally. In the United States NIH controls experiments and recommendations, and Europe tends to be more protective, though again, to diverse extents. 
 How Steps of the Research Process can Increase Credibility Check 

 1. Authority: 
 
 I used gov and edu sites, reputable newspapers/magazines – Nature and Science. Some of the sources used were Doudna, and Charpentier, prominent molecular biologists because of their contributions made in the field. 

 2. Accuracy: 
 
 The details were extracted from several reliable sources to avoid the possibility of the misinformation. This was obtained from peer-reviewed journals that gave elaborated and well authenticated data. 

 3. Objectivity: 
 
 I tested for bias by using both academic and news articles. An academic article is purposed to educate in a politically unbiased way while news might focus some aspects. I had included both the views in order to have the balanced opinion. 

 4. Currency: 
 
 Current articles and updates were considered for the current trend and other new research studies available. The sources were selected based on the fact that they were published not earlier than the last 5 years. 

 5. Coverage: 
 
 The articles and source materials range from densely scientific and specialized studies to analytical overviews of the topic, as well as institutional reports, to convey the breadth of SCIENCE, APPLICATIONS, and ETHICS of CRISPR. Sources came with extended lists of references so as to encourage further reading on the same issues.

Five Bits of Info:

1. where: General Theory of Relativity

– Proposed by Albert Einstein in 1915

(The curvature of space-time due to mass and energy) — Describes the gravity as@Configuration SOSYJ(k)(1.

- Changed the way we view gravity, replacing Newton's law of universal gravitation.

(illustrated by phenomena such as gravitational time dilation, the bending of light around massive objects or accelerated expansion of the universe…)

Experimental verification, e.g. bending of light (solar eclipse), precession of perihelion motion for Mercury

2. Special Theory of Relativity:

Invented by Einstein in 1905.

– Relates to the physics of objects traveling at constant velocities, particularly those near the speed of light

Confirmed the laws of physics are identical for all non-accelerating observers

Brought to light the concepts of time dilation and length contraction.

- E = mc², which shows the equivalence of mass and energy.

3. Gravitational Waves:

Pictured: As Predicted By Einstein's General Theory Of Relativity

Ripples in spacetime created by moving mass i.e. merging black holes

First traced directly back to 2015 thanks to LIGO/Virgo.

– Gave us a new way to see the cosmos with gravitational wave astronomy.

Verified many predictions of general relativity, and suggested ideas about how black holes and neutron stars could operate.

4. Black Holes:

Areas of space where the gravity is so intense that even light cannot break free.

— a direct consequence of the equations of general relativity.

Defined by an event horizon, the boundary beyond which events cannot affect any other.

The observational evidences are the detection of X-ray emissions and recent photos in case of a black hole event horizon by Event Horizon Telescope.

. Involved in studies of high energy astrophysical processes and the formation & evolution of galaxies,

5. **The Cosmological Constant (Λ):

* Proposed by Einstein in 1917 as an amendment of his field equations of general relativity.

Characterizes an energy density that fills space homogeneously.

– Originally postulated in order to obtain a universe model which was not expanding, eventually dropped after expansionist theory – Proposed for the sake of solution with static (non-expanding) universe that got thrown out once we figured out how nuclear warping fits into data- Swain et al.

- Now seen as an energy, a form of dark energy that pushes the universe to accelerate its expansion.

Collaborator a key ingredient in the standard theory, like other elements that determine what may be our fate as we live amongst a vast expanding universe.

#### Research Process:

1. Authority:

– Primary source: papers by albert einstein

— Secondary sources: Research papers and books from physicists like Stephen Hawking, Brian Greene etc.

- Trusted sites: NASA, European Space Agency (ESA) and universities as MIT or Caltech.

2. Accuracy:

Researched and Cross-referenced fromVariousReputableSources

– Fact-check the particular scientific claims with peer-reviewed articles and reputable science databases (JSTOR or Google Scholar)

Determined scientific consensus is related to facts

3. Objectivity:

Chose sources that reported accurate information without providing a clear bias.

Skip sources with clickbait and writing that offers opinion instead of information.

Centered around educational materials and not explicitly biased towards a particular point of view.

4. Currency:

Recent Publications and Updates on Theory of general Relativity — Favourites+

The newest experimental results, such as the discovery of gravitational waves in 2015.

- Reviewed the sources to check they were up-to-date and accurate with current scientific understanding in order not to mislead half-educated readers.

5. Coverage:

Hardin: - Picked sources that cover the theory of relativity more planes

Detailed explanations Historical Context Mathematical Formulation Experimental Evidence

      -- Information Searching Process: 
To clearly understand the information on Electric Vehicles, I had to embark on a multi-step process in research.                                                    
                                  Sources used ranged from scholarly articles, industry reports, and other authority sites. Every source used was reviewed in line with the 5-point framework so as to point out the credibility as well as the relevance of the same source. Five Things Every Person Needs to Know about Electric Vehicles:

Types of Electric Vehicles: Battery Electric Vehicles: They are purely run by electricity stored in the batteries. PHEVs: They use a battery and an internal combustion engine that is chargeable via an external power source. Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs): They also have an internal combustion engine besides a battery; however, for HEVs, it gets charged through regenerative braking rather than by any external sources.

1. Benefits of Electric Vehicle:

- Environment: As stated above, EVs discharge or emit zero from the tailpipe.So, there will be lesser air pollution and lesser greenhouse gases.
-  Energy Efficiency: More than 60% of the electric energy supplied to it by the grid can be transformed into power at the wheel by EVs. Less than 20% can be turned into energy on behalf of conventional gasoline cars. 
- Lower Running Costs: 
Electricity usually is cheaper than gasoline; likewise, with EVs, there are generally fewer moving parts involved, hence less maintenance costs.

2. Problems of Electric Vehicles:

- Range Anxiety: Some of the ranges of EVs are so low compared to that of gas-powered cars, they create a fear of running out of electric power.
-  Charging Infrastructure: The availability and accessibility amongst the available charging stations are different to a great extent and hence acts as a barrier to its wide usage. 
- Battery Disposal: Disposal and recycling of old batteries from EVs remain an environmental and logistical challenge as of now.

3. Market Trends:

- Growth: The global EV market is on a positive growth track due to the increased investment from the private and public sectors. 
- Government Incentives: Secure several governments that give incentives and subsidies for adopting EVs, including tax credits and rebates.
-  Improvements in Technology: Performance and Convenience—upgrades in battery and those of charging technology.

4. Key Players in EV:

- Tesla is known for its pioneering work on battery technology and autonomous driving features. 
- Nissan: The Nissan Leaf just happens to be among the top-selling electric cars worldwide.
-  BYD: One of the large Chinese manufacturers featured as one of the largest electric vehicle makers and topping the list in battery production.

Five Bits of Info:

1. where: *General Theory of Relativity*

– Proposed by Albert Einstein in 1915

(The curvature of space-time due to mass and energy) — Describes the gravity as@Configuration SOSYJ(k)(1.

~ Changed the way we view gravity, replacing Newton's law of universal gravitation. ~

(illustrated by phenomena such as gravitational time dilation, the bending of light around massive objects or accelerated expansion of the universe…)

Experimental verification, e.g. bending of light (solar eclipse), precession of perihelion motion for Mercury

2. Special Theory of Relativity:

Invented by Einstein in 1905.

– Relates to the physics of objects traveling at constant velocities, particularly those near the speed of light

Confirmed the laws of physics are identical for all non-accelerating observers

Brought to light the concepts of time dilation and length contraction.

- E = mc², which shows the equivalence of mass and energy.

3. *Gravitational Waves*:

Pictured: As Predicted By Einstein's General Theory Of Relativity

Ripples in spacetime created by moving mass i.e. merging black holes

First traced directly back to 2015 thanks to LIGO/Virgo.

– Gave us a new way to see the cosmos with gravitational wave astronomy.

Verified many predictions of general relativity, and suggested ideas about how black holes and neutron stars could operate.

4. *Black Holes*:

Areas of space where the gravity is so intense that even light cannot break free.

— a direct consequence of the equations of general relativity.

Defined by an event horizon, the boundary beyond which events cannot affect any other.

The observational evidences are the detection of X-ray emissions and recent photos in case of a black hole event horizon by Event Horizon Telescope.

. Involved in studies of high energy astrophysical processes and the formation & evolution of galaxies,

5. **The Cosmological Constant (Λ):

• Proposed by Einstein in 1917 as an amendment of his field equations of general relativity.

Characterizes an energy density that fills space homogeneously.

– Originally postulated in order to obtain a universe model which was not expanding, eventually dropped after expansionist theory – Proposed for the sake of solution with static (non-expanding) universe that got thrown out once we figured out how nuclear warping fits into data- Swain et al.

- Now seen as an energy, a form of dark energy that pushes the universe to accelerate its expansion.

Collaborator a key ingredient in the standard theory, like other elements that determine what may be our fate as we live amongst a vast expanding universe.

#### Research Process:

1. *Authority*:

– Primary source: papers by albert einstein

— Secondary sources: Research papers and books from physicists like Stephen Hawking, Brian Greene etc.

- Trusted sites: NASA, European Space Agency (ESA) and universities as MIT or Caltech.

2. *Accuracy*:

Researched and Cross-referenced fromVariousReputableSources

– Fact-check the particular scientific claims with peer-reviewed articles and reputable science databases (JSTOR or Google Scholar)

Determined scientific consensus is related to facts

3. *Objectivity*:

Chose sources that reported accurate information without providing a clear bias.

Skip sources with clickbait and writing that offers opinion instead of information.

Centered around educational materials and not explicitly biased towards a particular point of view.

4. *Currency*:

Recent Publications and Updates on Theory of general Relativity — Favourites+

The newest experimental results, such as the discovery of gravitational waves in 2015.

- Reviewed the sources to check they were up-to-date and accurate with current scientific understanding in order not to mislead half-educated readers.

5. *Coverage*:

Hardin: - Picked sources that cover the theory of relativity more planes

Detailed explanations Historical Context Mathematical Formulation Experimental Evidence

However, over time, the work became monotonous and unchallenging. Despite feeling increasingly dissatisfied and unfulfilled, I stayed in the position for an additional year.\n\nWhy the Bias Occurred:\nThe commitment bias occurred because I had invested significant time and effort into my role. I had built relationships with colleagues, developed a sense of stability, and felt a strong desire to stay consistent with my previous decision to join the company. Additionally, I feared that leaving the job would be seen as admitting failure or a lack of perseverance to my friends, family, and professional network.\n\nOvercoming the Bias:\nI eventually overcame the commitment bias by objectively evaluating my situation.

I sought advice from mentors and peers, who helped me see that changing jobs was a positive step for my career growth. By focusing on my long-term goals and recognizing that my current job was hindering my progress, I gained the courage to resign and pursue a more fulfilling opportunity elsewhere.\n\nSituation 2: Holding onto a Declining Investment\nContext:\nSeveral years ago, I invested a substantial amount of money in a startup that showed great potential. Initially, the investment performed well, but after a while, the startup faced significant challenges and its value began to decline.

","I once chose subjects to study out of curiosity and gradually lost interest in them in the long run. But i couldn't change my subjects because I had already put in a lot of time and effort into it. It would be a pain to start over again right from the beginning. 
Instead of whining and disliking it so much, I tried to find the good in it and tried to understand and enjoy the subject as much as I could. 

When I suddenly get the urge to paint, but once I begin the process I lose interest midway because it does not come to my expectations. But I don't want to leave it incomplete either. 
Instead of leaving it incomplete, I chose to go with the flow, because in the end no matter what it looks like, it will be unique and different in its own special way.

Why: I was biased towards the brand due to familiarity and positive past experiences, and overlooked other brands that may have offered better features and value for money.
Overcame it: I overcame it learning about new models of laptops recently lauched talk to an tech expert about it and I got to know there are more better advance options in the market.

2. Situation: I was drawn to a certain field in career because I had always envisioned myself working in it and had heard positive things from people within that industry. However, I hadn't fully researched other fields that might align more with my skills and interests.
Why: My commitment bias likely occurred because I had already mentally committed to the idea of pursuing that career path. I felt a sense of comfort and certainty in that choice, even without exploring other possibilities.

The first situation where I dealth with commitment bias was when I chose python as my first language as it was wasy to learn. I had Java session whwn I was in school till my 10th grade. I chose science as my stream during my 11th and 12th grade so I lost track in Java. As I joined Kalvium and I was in a a situation to choose a primary and a secondary language. I was so clueless. 
We had problem solving using programing where we started solving problems using python so I choose Python. I was so clear that lot of students would choose python as it is easy to learn but the demand for python programmers in th corporate has drastically reduced. I knew it clearly but as I started doing it I chose it as my primary language as I was so commited to it since I started during it for the course Problem Solving Using Programming. It's been 2 years since I stopped working on java so by now I have zero knowledge in Java so I knew I have to start learning it from first but I chose it as  I remember that I used to love Java back then during my school and used to score good. 
The problem here was in my class only 1 person is doing Java so if I have any doubt the rate of being helped would be less as most people chose CPP but my commitment towards Java made me chose it.
I didn't overcome the bias, because there is no choice left to think as I started attending my belt test a month ago so now I have my first belt in Java and Python but as my decision was wrong I'm not able to get another belt in Java.

2. The second situation when I dealt with commitment bias was when I continued watching a whole drama before the day of my exam just because I started watching it and I had the mindset to end it before I sleep. I had my exam the next day and I had no clue what I'm going to do. 
I thought of preparing for the exam at night but remembered a drama that I've been planning to watch for so long and it made me curious. It is so  obvious that we get the curiosity to do everything except studying before the exam day. I started watching an episode and promised myself that I'll start studying after that episode but I became least bothered about the next day's exam. I was commited to the thought of completing the drama which proved my bad decision making skill because as a result I suffered the next day without knowing what to do for my exams.",10,,"The first situation, while relevant, lacks a complete conclusion and could benefit from more clarity and coherence.

**Context**: During my final year of high school, I was set on pursuing an engineering degree at a particular university. I had invested significant time and effort in preparing my application, researching the university, and even visiting the campus. When I received an offer from the university, I was excited but also faced with a growing concern about the program’s fit with my long-term goals. Despite my doubts, I felt compelled to accept the offer due to the substantial commitment I had already made.

**Why the Bias Occurred**: The commitment bias occurred because of the significant investment I had already made in pursuing this specific program. I had invested time, energy, and emotional commitment into the decision, which made me reluctant to reconsider even though I had reservations about the program's alignment with my goals. The bias led me to stick with my initial decision to avoid acknowledging that my prior commitment might have been misdirected.

**How I Overcame the Bias**: I overcame the commitment bias by conducting a thorough review of my goals and the program’s alignment with them. I sought advice from mentors and talked to current students about their experiences. This process helped me realize that another program might better suit my aspirations. I decided to apply to additional programs, ultimately selecting one that better fit my long-term career goals, even though it meant reevaluating my previous commitment.

### Situation 2: Starting a Business Venture

**Context**: I once started a small business based on a concept I was passionate about. After investing a significant amount of money and time into the venture, I began to notice that the market conditions were not as favorable as I had anticipated. Despite the warning signs and feedback suggesting that the business might not succeed, I was reluctant to pivot or shut down the venture due to the considerable commitment I had already made.

**Why the Bias Occurred**: The commitment bias occurred because I had invested a large amount of personal and financial resources into the business. This made me unwilling to abandon or change the direction of the venture, even when it became evident that continuing might not be the best decision. I wanted to justify my previous investments and efforts, which led me to ignore practical concerns about the business’s viability.

**Why I Couldn't Overcome the Bias**: In this case, overcoming the commitment bias was challenging due to the emotional and financial stakes involved. The more I invested, the harder it became to accept that the business might not succeed. I struggled with the idea of admitting failure and the financial loss that would come with it. This emotional attachment to my initial investment hindered my ability to make a rational decision about the business's future, leading to prolonged difficulties and eventual regret.",10,,Originality is missing. ,0,54.54545455,10

Our development team had put in a lot of time and resources on how we should implement a feature for a software development project. Even after it became apparent that another, easier way was indeed available, none of us were particularly willing to course-correct. The bias emerged due to the considerable investment of time and effort already devoted to the initial strategy, making it challenging to recognize its deficiencies without perceiving it as an admission of failure. The potential transition to a new direction appeared overwhelming, compounded by our emotional and financial commitments to the original plan.

To counter this prejudice, I conducted an in-depth review of the progress made toward the project and prepared a cost-benefit analysis of the alternative approach.

By presenting arguments based on empirical data and focusing on future benefits rather than sunk costs, I was able to persuade the team to accept the new methodology. By pointing out the overall goals of the project and framing the change as an opportunity for improvement rather than a nuisance, it was easier to shift the team's perspective. This approach allowed us to take the required adjustments effectively and ultimately achieve a better outcome. Alternatively, I also experienced commitment bias when developing a marketing campaign for a new product launch. Our team had committed to a certain approach based on initial research and early findings. However, as the campaign progressed, new data indicated that another approach might be more effective. Because of the previous commitment and pressure associated with the appearance of indecision, we were slow to make adjustments. The bias came from our perception that changing course at this moment would undermine our credibility and invalidate any work we'd invested in the process so far.

It was hard for me to get over the bias despite recognizing it, since changing the strategy was not only about shifting approach but also required additional resources and a revised timeline. The fact that the organization was reluctant to deploy more resources, together with the risk of negative feedback from customers, led us to cancel the recently developed strategy. Therefore, we continued with the old plan, which, though not disastrous, did not achieve the best possible outcome for the company when compared to a more flexible approach.",10,,"The answer could benefit from providing more specific details about the marketing campaign situation, such as the nature of the new data and the potential effectiveness of the alternative approach.

**Context:** When beginning with front-end work, I decided to use a particular framework and dedicated a lot of time towards the creation of the site in its application. In this case, I also realized that there is another relatively new framework that provides higher performance and is equipped with more functions.

**Why the Bias Occurred:** That is the reason I was falling for commitment bias, having spent a lot of time learning and practicing the initial framework. Just switching to the newer conative/cognitive framework seemed to require me to say that my first decision was mistaken, and that made me hesitate to change.

**Outcome:** Even though I am aware the new framework is more effective I persisted in using the initial one for finishing the project. The bias was not overcome because I feared the additional time that would be taken to master the new framework and incorporate it into my work. But I then stated that the commitment stays at the old framework, it would not be as efficient or as functional for my project.

**The second situation: i3 Processor in My Laptop**

**Context:** When I got my laptop the processor that came installed was the Intel i3 processor. I remember over time that it had some issues when having to perform tasks that were more complicated or work on the newest productivity software. I found out that getting a more powerful processor in a laptop improved its performance, by a wide margin.

**Why the Bias Occurred:** Commitment was another force that I felt compelled to stick to the laptop with the i3 processor because I had already sunk my hard-earned cash in the machine, and would not like to be forced to go back to the drawing board and confess that the machine was not good enough for me. I also realized that upgrading might look like a waste of the money initially used to acquire it.

**Outcome:** Over time I thought it proper to change a laptop with a better processor. This I did by trying to view the issue from a neutral perspective and focusing on how the news laptop would enhance my performance. Accepting the fact that the initial investment was not the only criterion that could help improve the performance of the vehicle was enough to motivate the change.",10,,,8,100.0,8

we stay in a long term relationship that is no longer fulfilling or healthy because of the time and effort we’ve invested in it. despite ongoing issues we continue to stay committed.
commitment bias occurs because of the emotional and time investment in the relationship. the longer we stay the harder it is to acknowledge that it may be time to move on.
to overcome this bias, engage in honest self reflection and consider whether the relationship aligns with our long term well-being and goals. seeking counseling or support from friends and family can also provide perspective.
if we don’t overcome it, it might be due to fear of change, the social stigma of ending a long-term relationship or the hope that things will improve if you just stay committed longer.

2) remaining in an unfulfilling job:
we’ve been in a particular job role for many years. although the role has become unsatisfying and offers limited growth, we stay because of the long tenure and loyalty to the company.
commitment bias occurs because of the significant time and effort invested in the role and the company. the longer we stay, the harder it is to consider moving on.
overcoming this bias involves evaluating job satisfaction and career goals objectively. engaging in career counseling and exploring new opportunities can help us make a more informed decision.
if we don’t overcome it, it might be due to comfort with the status quo, fear of change or the perceived risk of moving to a new job.",10,,"The answer could benefit from a more detailed description of the situations and the specific challenges faced due to commitment bias.

During my high school years, I was very involved in a coding project that I started with a few friends. We were working on developing a simple game using a specific programming framework that I had initially chosen. As the project progressed, I learned about a different framework that was more efficient and better suited for our needs. However, I felt a strong sense of commitment to the original framework since I was the one who had advocated for it. This commitment bias made me hesitant to suggest switching frameworks, even though it was clear that the new one would lead to better results. Eventually, after some reflection and encouragement from my teammates, I realized that sticking with the old framework was holding us back. I overcame the bias by focusing on the project's success rather than my attachment to the initial decision. We made the switch, and the project improved significantly.

Situation 2:
I once invested a considerable amount of time and effort into researching a particular stock for investment. I was convinced it would perform well, so I recommended it to a few friends. However, over time, it became evident that the stock was underperforming, and there were better opportunities available. Despite this, I found myself clinging to my initial choice, driven by a desire to avoid admitting that my recommendation might have been a mistake. This commitment bias prevented me from re-evaluating my decision objectively. In this case, I struggled to overcome the bias because my ego was tied to the recommendation, and I was worried about losing credibility. It took me some time to accept that sticking with a poor investment wasn't beneficial for anyone, and eventually, I decided to cut my losses and move on.

Solutions:
One way I overcame commitment bias in the first situation was by shifting my focus from proving myself right to ensuring the success of the project. By detaching my self-worth from the initial decision and prioritizing the overall goal, I was able to make a more rational choice that benefited everyone involved. Open communication with my team also played a crucial role in helping me see the situation from a broader perspective.

In the second situation, overcoming the bias was more challenging because it was deeply tied to my self-image and the fear of losing face. I learned that acknowledging mistakes is a sign of growth rather than weakness. Surrounding myself with supportive people who value progress over perfection helped me gradually move past the bias. It was a humbling experience, but it taught me the importance of flexibility and the value of learning from every decision, even the wrong ones.",10,,"The only minor drawback is that the solutions provided at the end could have been more directly linked to the specific situations described.

**Situation 1**

*Situation* - The new phone I bought. 

*Explanation* - I recently got an Iphone 15 cause I asked for oone after boards results came out. The only reason I asked for one was because all my friends were iphone users and I didnt wanna be the odd one out. But I have come to realisation that Iphone's are not that good and just have brand value as they have quite a  lot of issues with them. For example: Their battery life is terrible and the overheat quite a bit as well. 

*How commitment bias is coming* -  Iphones are a costly investment. After 2 months of using it and finding all the issues that it has I have come to realise that I should have just bought a flagship model of an android as it would be the same price but would've had a lot more features than the iphone that im currently using. The commitment bias is that the phone was a costly investment as a result of which I have to use it.

*Did I overcome or not ?* - I haven't been able to overcome it because this phone was a gift from my parents and I am not financially independant enough yet to just switch phones. Hence, I have not been able to overcome this bias because I had previously put in a lot of money into this purchase

**Situation 2**

*Situation* - Brand Loyalty(Nike)

*Explanation* - I have this issue with my left ankle where it hurts if I do any excersise or walk a lot on hard soled shoes. So, After trying out multiple brands including Bata, Adidas, Puma, Reebok and many other I came to the conclusion that Nike was the best. The comfort that I got from their shoes were amazing and I was able to excersise a lot longer without the ankle pain affecting me.

*How the commitment bias is coming* - I have spent a lot of money trying out different shoes and finally found the perfect one. I dont want to spend any more trying to find a better one knowing I would just have to spend a lot more. I found the brand that meets my needs and expectations and hence I do not even want to try finding another.

*Did I overcome or not ?* -  I have gotten over it by just not searching for another brand as I am quite satisfied with the current brand that I have picked. I do not have to lose more money or time and hence I have gotten over it.",10,The answer demonstrates a clear understanding of commitment bias and provides relevant situations where the bias occurred. The context and description of both situations are clear and sufficient to understand the bias. The examples provided effectively illustrate how and why commitment bias occurred in each situation. The conclusion for each situation is complete and provides insight into whether the bias was overcome or not.,"The answer could benefit from more concise and focused descriptions of the situations to avoid unnecessary details.

However, over time, the work became monotonous and unchallenging.

Context:  I signed up for a half yearly subscription service for entertainment purposes. After a few months, I realized that I wasn't using the service as much as I had anticipated. However, I continued paying for the subscription.

Why the Bias Occurred:  The bias occurred because I had already invested several months of subscription fees and felt that cancelling would mean that those past investments were wasted. Additionally, there was a psychological commitment to not admitting that the decision to subscribe was a mistake.

Overcoming the Bias:  To overcome this bias, I reassessed the value of continuing the subscription against my current needs and usage. I realized that the ongoing cost outweighed any potential benefit, so I decided to cancel the subscription. I focused on the future benefit of reallocating the money to something more useful rather than the sunk cost of the past payments.




Example 2: A Long-Running TV Series named Suits.

Context:  I was a huge fan of Suits that had been running for several seasons. Initially, the show was engaging, with well-developed characters and had intriguing plotlines. However, as the series progressed, the quality began to decline. The storylines became repetitive, and the character development suffered. Despite this, I continued watching each new episode, hoping that it would return to its earlier glory.

Why the Bias Occurred:  The commitment bias here was driven by the significant investment of time and emotional energy I had already made in following the series. I didn’t want to admit that the show had lost its charm and felt that discontinuing it would mean all the time spent watching was for nothing. Adding on, there was a part of me that hoped the series would redeem itself and return to its former greatness.

Overcoming the Bias:  Later, I realized that continuing to watch a show that no longer brought me joy was not a productive use of my time. I looked for new shows and genres that better aligned with my current interests and preferences. Soon, I was able to enjoy my entertainment time more and stop investing in a series that no longer met my expectations. This decision helped me discover new and more satisfying shows, ultimately enhancing my overall entertainment experience.",10,"The answer demonstrates a clear understanding of commitment bias and provides relevant and well-described situations for both examples.

However, over time, the work became monotonous and unchallenging. Despite feeling increasingly dissatisfied and unfulfilled, I stayed in the position for an additional year.\n\nWhy the Bias Occurred:\nThe commitment bias occurred because I had invested significant time and effort into my role. I had built relationships with colleagues, developed a sense of stability, and felt a strong desire to stay consistent with my previous decision to join the company. Additionally, I feared that leaving the job would be seen as admitting failure or a lack of perseverance to my friends, family, and professional network.\n\nOvercoming the Bias:\nI eventually overcame the commitment bias by objectively evaluating my situation. I created a pros and cons list and realized that the cons significantly outweighed the pros. I sought advice from mentors and peers, who helped me see that changing jobs was a positive step for my career growth. By focusing on my long-term goals and recognizing that my current job was hindering my progress, I gained the courage to resign and pursue a more fulfilling opportunity elsewhere.\n\nSituation 2: Holding onto a Declining Investment\nContext:\nSeveral years ago, I invested a substantial amount of money in a startup that showed great potential. Initially, the investment performed well, but after a while, the startup faced significant challenges and its value began to decline. Despite the warning signs, I held onto the investment, hoping for a turnaround.\n\nWhy the Bias Occurred:\nThe commitment bias was driven by my emotional attachment to the initial success of the investment and the substantial financial resources I had already committed. I was reluctant to accept the reality that the startup might fail, as it would mean admitting that my investment decision was flawed. Additionally, I was influenced by the sunk cost fallacy, where I focused more on the money already invested rather than the future potential of the startup.\n\nFailing to Overcome the Bias:\nI couldn't overcome the bias because I allowed my emotions to cloud my judgment. Despite receiving advice from financial advisors to cut my losses, I remained hopeful that the startup would recover. My unwillingness to accept the loss and the fear of admitting a mistake prevented me from making a rational decision. Ultimately, the startup failed, and I lost a significant portion of my investment. This experience taught me the importance of making decisions based on objective analysis rather than emotional attachment.""}, {""solution"": ""Situation 1: Continuing a Unfulfilling Job\nContext:\nA few years ago, I worked at a job that I didn’t enjoy much anymore.

I have taken Math-Cs in my 12th stream selection. Once i took  CS, which was a very new subject to me that time, i regretted the decision everyday whenever i sit in my Cs periods. But then due to the commitment bias, i kept studying it even though for some point in my life i thought it wouldn't be relevant for me to study cs.
But now i have overcome it by choosing cs as my major in college. End ofmy 12th, i actually found the subject interesting and the consistency of studying it, even if didnt't like it , made me want to choose this field. That's how i overcame the bias.

","1. **Definition of False Arrest**: In the general sense, a false arrest is defined as the unlawful deprivation of the liberty of a person. The false arrest could only be established if Mr. Thornton could prove that the arrest was effected without any legal authority or reasonable cause.

2. **Application of Store Policy**: Even though the store manager applied a policy which Mr. Thornton had never seen, the real question should be if the store had the right to change such a procedure and if the request for Mr. Thornton to speak with employees in the back room was lawful under the union contract and store policies.

3. **False Arrest**: For an arrest to be considered ""false,"" the arrestors must be shown to have lacked probable cause, or sufficient grounds, for the arrest. If Thrifty Drug had a legitimate reason, such as a violation of shop policy, and communicated that to the police, then the arrest would not be false. However, Mr. Thornton could use the fact that he had established a practice and that the change in this case was unjustified.

4. **Police Action to be Reasonable**: The police must act only when there is reasonable cause. This means that if Mr. Thornton was arrested on unreasonable grounds or the demand by the store was not reasonable, the arrest would be unlawful.

5. **Dismissal of Charges**: Although dismissal of charges is not an indicator of a false arrest, it is helpful in establishing Mr. Thornton's case because it points out that, as far as the system is concerned, no grounds existed for his arrest.
 Why WYSIATI May Lead Us to Believe Mr. Thornton's Case

WYSIATI: This stands for what you see is all there is. It refers to the cognitive bias when people make judgments exclusively on whatever information is available at that moment to them, excluding what may be missing. The reason may cause the influence of perception about the situation in the following way:

1. **Immediate Perception**: We see the version from the side of Mr. Thornton first; afterwards, having him in handcuffs and dropping the charges might have seemed pretty unfair to our sympathetic minds.

2. **Lack of Knowledge**: WYSIATI might cause us to overlook more background information, such as the store's internal policy or any previous complaints about Mr. Thornton's visits. Unless we know all the procedures the store follows in such cases, or any earlier reason for the enforcement of such a new policy, we might easily jump to the unwarranted conclusion that the arrest was unjustified.

3. **Emotional Response**: The picture of Mr. Thornton refusing to back down and being forcibly handcuffed may emotionally sideswipe us and lead us into accepting his version of the events as more valid without critical consideration of all the pertinent facts.

Ultimately, whether Mr. Thornton has a valid suit against Thrifty Drug Store depends on the particulars of the legal rationale of his arrest. At this point, WYSIATI might make us believe his claim based on immediate and partial information provided and erase the complete context and legalities of the case.",10,,,9,100.0,8

","David Thornton’s potential lawsuit against Thrifty Drug Store for false arrest hinges on several key issues:

1. *Legal Grounds for False Arrest*: To establish a claim for false arrest, Mr. Thornton would need to demonstrate that he was detained without legal justification. In this case, Thrifty Drug Store called the police based on their enforcement of a previously overlooked store policy. The policy change, while abrupt, was within their rights under the union contract. Therefore, the question of whether the arrest was legally justified depends on whether Mr. Thornton's refusal to leave constituted a breach of the store’s rules that warranted police involvement.

2. *Abiding by Store Policy*: The store’s request for Mr. Thornton to meet with employees only in a back room during breaks was a change in procedure, but it was a procedure they were entitled to enforce as per the union contract. Since Mr. Thornton refused to comply and chose to remain on the floor, the store had grounds to call the police if they believed he was trespassing.

3. *Nature of Arrest*: Although Mr. Thornton was handcuffed and briefly detained, the charges were dropped, which implies that no formal legal proceedings were pursued. This might affect the claim's strength, as the lack of charges could be seen as an indication that the arrest was more of a misunderstanding or misapplication of the store’s policy rather than a malicious act.

4. *The Principle of False Arrest*: For false arrest, the core issue is whether the arresting authority (in this case, the police) had proper grounds based on the store’s complaint. If the store genuinely believed that Mr. Thornton's presence violated their policy and could lead to disruption or other issues, their decision to involve the police might be seen as a reasonable, though perhaps overzealous, response.

WYSIATI (What You See Is All There Is) Influence:

*WYSIATI* is a cognitive bias where people make judgments based on the information readily available to them, without considering thesibility of missing information. In this case, WYSIATI may lead individuals to accept Mr. Thornton’s perspective because:

       
- *Personal Experience*: We might focus on the immediate, emotionally charged details of Mr. Thornton being handcuffed and detained, which seem unjust and excessive.
- *Limited View*: Observers may not consider the store's perspective or the legal nuances of the contract and store policies. The information that Thrifty Drug had the right to enforce the policy might not be as immediately visible or considered.
- *Simplicity of the Narrative*: The straightforward narrative of someone being wrongfully detained can overshadow more complex legal considerations or procedural justifications.
-That's what it is..",10,Good try,,10,54.54545455,7

","The case of Mr. Thornton against Thrifty Drug Store basically hinges on whether he was lawfully arrested or not. Here is a more simplified analysis of it:

The Facts Union representative David Thornton was making his regular visit to a Thrifty Drug Store when things took a turn for the worse. Normally, he could talk issues through with the employees on the selling floor. But today, the manager told him that he now had to meet with them in a back room. Though this was part of the union contract, it was new and, to this point, never enforced.

Mr. Thornton was frustrated because he had always been allowed to speak on the floor to employees so long as it didn't affect business. When Mr. Thornton refused to move his meeting, the manager called the police, at which point he said he would rather get arrested than change how he did his job. Mr. Thornton was handcuffed and placed briefly in a holding cell; although all charges were eventually dismissed.

Legal Points False Arrest Claim: To succeed on his claim of false arrest, Mr. Thornton would need to show that he was detained for no legitimate reason. While the store was within its rights to ask him to follow some new rules, it seems that calling the police to have him arrested was an overly broad response if he was not being disruptive in the store.

Union Contract: The store had a right to change the way Mr. Thornton approached the employees, but to do so in a manner that caused him to be arrested may present problems. If Mr. Thornton was adhering to the store's rules up until that time, the strong reaction may be called into question.

Justification for Arrest: Being told to move to a back room wouldn't appear to be worthy of having the police called on him, unless Mr. Thornton was causing an actual disturbance or violating some specific law. Since the charges were dismissed, that would lead one to believe the police perhaps viewed the incident as a misunderstanding more than a criminal action.

WYSIATI (What You See Is All There Is) WYSIATI—""What You See Is All There Is""—may make us judge the situation right away, off of the more dramatic elements. A person in handcuffs inside a store is wrong and unfair in itself, so we may easily accept that Mr. Thornton was treated badly. This visceral, immediate reaction may be overriding a more considered view as to whether the store had valid reasons for their actions, or whether there were other ways to handle the situation without police involvement.

Therefore, while Mr. Thornton may have a claim in his favour if he can prove that this was not a valid arrest, it is essential to look further than the obvious, emotionally-based parameters of this case to learn from it.",10,,"The answer could be improved by providing more specific legal reasoning and examples to support the claim of false arrest. Additionally, while the WYSIATI principle is explained well, the connection to the scenario could be more explicitly tied to the facts presented.",8,100.0,8
124,164,Critical Thinking 101,a759ab85-5601-4a10-982d-e88a1aa67f5f,"*On September 3, plaintiff David Thornton, a forty-three-year-old union field representative, was present in Thrifty Drug Store #168, performing a routine union visit. Within ten minutes of his arrival, a store manager confronted him and told him he could no longer speak with the union employees on the floor of the store. Instead, he would have to see them in a back room while they were on break. Such a request is allowed by the union contract with Thrifty Drug but had never before been enforced. When Mr. Thornton objected, he was told that he had the choice of abiding by the rules, leaving the store, or being arrested. At this point, Mr. Thornton indicated to the manager that he had always been allowed to speak to employees on the floor for as much as ten minutes, as long as no business was disrupted, and that he would rather be arrested than change the procedure of his routine visit. The manager then called the police and had Mr. Thornton handcuffed in the store for trespassing. After he was booked and put into a holding cell for a brief time, all charges were dropped.

","David Thornton's Potential Lawsuit Against Thrifty Drug Store for False Arrest

Legal Basis for False Arrest: To pursue a false arrest claim, Mr. Thornton must demonstrate that he was detained without legal justification. Thrifty Drug Store called the police based on their enforcement of a store policy, which had recently been implemented and was aligned with their contract agreement with the union. The key issue is whether Mr. Thornton’s refusal to comply with the new policy constituted a legal violation warranting police involvement.

Adherence to Store Policy: Mr. Thornton’s refusal to meet store employees only in a designated back room during breaks transformed a previously informal request into an enforceable store rule, which was backed by the union contract. If Thrifty Drug Store reasonably believed that Mr. Thornton was trespassing or otherwise violating this policy, they had a basis for calling the police.

Nature of the Arrest: Although Mr. Thornton was handcuffed and briefly detained, the charges against him were ultimately dismissed. This outcome suggests that no formal legal action was taken, which may affect the strength of a false arrest claim. The absence of formal charges could be interpreted as indicating that the incident was treated as a minor infraction, which might weaken Mr. Thornton’s case by suggesting that any alleged false arrest was not a significant legal wrong.",10,,,10,100.0,6

","False Arrest Basics False arrest occurs when someone is unlawfully restrained or detained without legal authority. For Mr. Thornton to succeed in a claim for false arrest, he must demonstrate:

That he was detained or restrained: Mr. Thornton was handcuffed and taken to a holding cell, which qualifies as restraint. That the detention was without legal authority: This involves showing that the store manager had no legal right to call the police or that the police acted without proper justification. Key Points in This Case Union Contract: The contract specifies that union representatives must meet employees in a back room during breaks, though this had not been strictly enforced before. Mr. Thornton’s challenge is that he was accustomed to a different practice, but the contract does allow the change.

Refusal to Comply: Mr. Thornton’s refusal to move to the back room and insistence on staying on the floor of the store might have been seen as trespassing under the store's rules, even though he argued it was an exception.

Police Involvement: The store manager called the police after Mr. Thornton refused to leave or comply. The police booked him for trespassing but ultimately dropped all charges.

Legal Analysis Legality of Detention: If the store had a legitimate reason based on its rules and the contract, the police might have had reasonable grounds to detain Mr. Thornton temporarily. However, the legitimacy of the store's request and the subsequent police action could be contested if Mr. Thornton was not given a fair chance to comply or if the request was deemed unreasonable.

Reasonable Grounds: The key issue would be whether the store’s decision to call the police and have Mr. Thornton handcuffed was reasonable under the circumstances. The fact that Mr. Thornton was booked and then released without charges could indicate that the authorities may have considered the call premature or unwarranted.

Why WYSIATI Might Influence Perception WYSIATI stands for ""What You See Is All There Is,"" a concept from Daniel Kahneman’s work in cognitive psychology. It describes the tendency to base judgments on the information that is immediately available, without considering what might be missing or not visible.

","The case of Mr. Thornton against Thrifty Drug Store basically hinges on whether he was lawfully arrested or not. Here is a more simplified analysis of it:

The Facts
Union representative David Thornton was making his regular visit to a Thrifty Drug Store when things took a turn for the worse. Normally, he could talk issues through with the employees on the selling floor. But today, the manager told him that he now had to meet with them in a back room. Though this was part of the union contract, it was new and, to this point, never enforced.

Mr. Thornton was frustrated because he had always been allowed to speak on the floor to employees so long as it didn't affect business. When Mr. Thornton refused to move his meeting, the manager called the police, at which point he said he would rather get arrested than change how he did his job. Mr. Thornton was handcuffed and placed briefly in a holding cell; although all charges were eventually dismissed.

Legal Points
False Arrest Claim: To succeed on his claim of false arrest, Mr. Thornton would need to show that he was detained for no legitimate reason. While the store was within its rights to ask him to follow some new rules, it seems that calling the police to have him arrested was an overly broad response if he was not being disruptive in the store.

Union Contract: The store had a right to change the way Mr. Thornton approached the employees, but to do so in a manner that caused him to be arrested may present problems. If Mr. Thornton was adhering to the store's rules up until that time, the strong reaction may be called into question.

Justification for Arrest: Being told to move to a back room wouldn't appear to be worthy of having the police called on him, unless Mr. Thornton was causing an actual disturbance or violating some specific law. Since the charges were dismissed, that would lead one to believe the police perhaps viewed the incident as a misunderstanding more than a criminal action.

WYSIATI (What You See Is All There Is)
WYSIATI—""What You See Is All There Is""—may make us judge the situation right away, off of the more dramatic elements. A person in handcuffs inside a store is wrong and unfair in itself, so we may easily accept that Mr. Thornton was treated badly. This visceral, immediate reaction may be overriding a more considered view as to whether the store had valid reasons for their actions, or whether there were other ways to handle the situation without police involvement.

Therefore, while Mr. Thornton may have a claim in his favour if he can prove that this was not a valid arrest, it is essential to look further than the obvious, emotionally-based parameters of this case to learn from it.",10,clear understanding of the scenario,,10,100.0,8

Within ten minutes of his arrival, a store manager confronted him and told him he could no longer speak with the union employees on the floor of the store. Instead, he would have to see them in a back room while they were on break. Such a request is allowed by the union contract with Thrifty Drug but had never before been enforced. When Mr. Thornton objected, he was told that he had the choice of abiding by the rules, leaving the store, or being arrested. At this point, Mr. Thornton indicated to the manager that he had always been allowed to speak to employees on the floor for as much as ten minutes, as long as no business was disrupted, and that he would rather be arrested than change the procedure of his routine visit. The manager then called the police and had Mr. Thornton handcuffed in the store for trespassing. After he was booked and put into a holding cell for a brief time, all charges were dropped.

False Arrest Basics False arrest occurs when someone is unlawfully restrained or detained without legal authority. For Mr. Thornton to succeed in a claim for false arrest, he must demonstrate:

That he was detained or restrained: Mr. Thornton was handcuffed and taken to a holding cell, which qualifies as restraint. That the detention was without legal authority: This involves showing that the store manager had no legal right to call the police or that the police acted without proper justification. Key Points in This Case Union Contract: The contract specifies that union representatives must meet employees in a back room during breaks, though this had not been strictly enforced before. Mr. Thornton’s challenge is that he was accustomed to a different practice, but the contract does allow the change.

Refusal to Comply: Mr. Thornton’s refusal to move to the back room and insistence on staying on the floor of the store might have been seen as trespassing under the store's rules, even though he argued it was an exception.

Police Involvement: The store manager called the police after Mr. Thornton refused to leave or comply. The police booked him for trespassing but ultimately dropped all charges.

Legal Analysis Legality of Detention: If the store had a legitimate reason based on its rules and the contract, the police might have had reasonable grounds to detain Mr. Thornton temporarily. However, the legitimacy of the store's request and the subsequent police action could be contested if Mr. Thornton was not given a fair chance to comply or if the request was deemed unreasonable.

Reasonable Grounds: The key issue would be whether the store’s decision to call the police and have Mr. Thornton handcuffed was reasonable under the circumstances. The fact that Mr. Thornton was booked and then released without charges could indicate that the authorities may have considered the call premature or unwarranted.

Why WYSIATI Might Influence Perception WYSIATI stands for ""What You See Is All There Is,"" a concept from Daniel Kahneman’s work in cognitive psychology. It describes the tendency to base judgments on the information that is immediately available, without considering what might be missing or not visible.

Immediate Information: The immediate details – Mr. Thornton's handcuffing, booking, and the fact that charges were dropped – might lead one to conclude that the arrest was unjustified. The visible facts support Mr. Thornton’s perception of unfair treatment.

","n his legal battle involving Thrifty Drug Store over the issue of false arrest, Mr. Thornton would need to consider, first and foremost, whether the arrest was justified by law and secondly, he must prove that the enforcement of the rule was done in good faith. If it were found that the store's enforcement of the rule was in fact a pretext to interfere with Mr. Thornton's union activities, he would probably have a valid claim. Nevertheless, in the instances that the rule was enforced impartially and in accordance with the provisions of the contract, the store could possibly have had valid grounds for arrest.

WYSIATI (What You See Is All There Is) :

WYSIATI is a cognitive bias where people make judgments based on the information immediately available to them, without considering what might be missing or the broader context. In Mr. Thornton’s case:

Immediate Information: Seeing Mr. Thornton being handcuffed and arrested, might lead us to automatically conclude that the arrest was wrongful if we do not have all the context about the rule enforcement or the broader relationship between the parties.

Selective Attention: We might focus on the dramatic aspects (handcuffing, arrest) rather than the procedural or contractual background that might justify the store's actions.

WYSIATI can lead us to accept the arrest as unjust without fully considering the contractual obligations and fairness in the enforcement of new rules.",10,Good explanation,,10,100.0,7

","1- False Arrest: This claim typically involves the assertion that a person was detained or restrained of their liberty without legal justification. For Thornton to successfully claim false arrest, he must demonstrate that:

2- He Was Detained Without Legal Justification:

Thornton was told he was trespassing and was subsequently handcuffed and detained by the police.
The store manager’s request to have Thornton meet employees in a back room, though it was a change from previous practices, was within the scope of the union contract.
Trespassing:

3- Trespassing generally means being on property without permission. If the store manager had the authority to set the terms for Thornton's visit and those terms were violated, the store might argue they had a right to call the police. However, since the union contract did allow Thornton to meet employees on the floor, the justification for calling the police could be questioned.
Authority and Enforcement:

4- If the manager’s order was lawful under the contract but not previously enforced, and if Thornton refused to comply, the store might argue they were enforcing a valid policy. However, whether the action taken (calling the police and having him handcuffed) was a reasonable response is debatable.
Analysis of the Case
Contractual Obligation: Thornton’s contract allowed him to meet employees on the floor. The sudden enforcement of a rule requiring him to meet employees in a back room might be seen as unreasonable or a change in procedure that was not properly communicated.

5- Reasonableness of Response: Handcuffing and arresting Thornton for refusing to comply with a procedure that had not been enforced before could be viewed as an excessive response, particularly if no business was being disrupted.

6- Legal Considerations: Whether Thornton can prove false arrest depends on whether the store’s actions were lawful and whether the police had a valid basis for the arrest. Since all charges were dropped, it suggests there was no legal justification for his arrest.

7- WYSIATI (What You See Is All There Is) Bias
WYSIATI Bias: This cognitive bias refers to our tendency to rely only on the information immediately available to us and to make judgments based on that limited perspective. Here’s how WYSIATI might affect perceptions of this case:

8- Initial Impression: Observers might focus on the dramatic elements of the case—Thornton being handcuffed and arrested—without considering the full context of the store’s policies or the contractual obligations.

9- Incomplete Information: People might not fully consider that the store might have had a valid, if previously unenforced, policy and that the situation could have involved complex legal and procedural aspects. Instead, they might see the arrest as inherently unjust based on the visible details.

10- Simplified Narrative: The narrative of Thornton being unfairly arrested might overshadow the subtler, legal nuances of the store’s actions and Thornton’s response, leading to a more emotionally driven judgment.

Conclusion
Mr. Thornton may have grounds for a false arrest claim, particularly if the store’s enforcement of the policy was unreasonable or if the police action was excessive. The case hinges on legal specifics and the reasonableness of the store’s response to Thornton's refusal to comply with the new procedure. WYSIATI can cause people to focus on the arrest's dramatic aspects, potentially oversimplifying the legal complexities involved.",10,"the scenario understanding, reasoning, and connection to WYSIATI are good in the assignment.

","Mr. Thornton could have a case against Thrifty Drug Store for false arrest, but it depends on several things.

Reasons Mr. Thornton Might Win:

Illegal Arrest: If Mr. Thornton was following the union contract and not causing any trouble, his arrest for trespassing might not be legal. The store manager could only make rules about where to meet, but if Mr. Thornton was following the rules and had no warning to leave, then the arrest might not be justified.

Procedural Issues: If Thrifty Drug Store never had a rule about meeting in the back room and Mr. Thornton was doing it before, then suddenly making that rule and arresting him could be seen as unfair or discriminatory.

Rights Violation: If the rule about not meeting in the back room was new and never used before, and Mr. Thornton was arrested as a punishment for following old practices, it could be a violation of his rights, especially if the arrest was a punishment for his actions.

WYSIATI (What You See Is All There Is) and This Case:

WYSIATI is when people make judgments based on the information they have at the moment, without considering what might be missing or unknown. In this case, people might think Mr. Thornton was right or wrong based on the information they have, without looking at:

Thrifty Drug’s policies and how they've been enforced before.
If Mr. Thornton broke any specific rules that were not mentioned.
If the store manager followed the right steps to handle disputes.
Because of WYSIATI, people might think Mr. Thornton is clearly in the right or wrong without seeing the full picture. This could lead to a simple view of whether Mr. Thornton's arrest was a false arrest or if there were good reasons for him to be removed from the store.",10,The answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the scenario and provides relevant reasons for Mr. Thornton's potential case against Thrifty Drug Store.

","The case of Mr. Thornton against Thrifty Drug Store basically hinges on whether he was lawfully arrested or not. Here is a more simplified analysis of it:

The Facts
Union representative David Thornton was making his regular visit to a Thrifty Drug Store when things took a turn for the worse. Normally, he could talk issues through with the employees on the selling floor. But today, the manager told him that he now had to meet with them in a back room. Though this was part of the union contract, it was new and, to this point, never enforced.

Mr. Thornton was frustrated because he had always been allowed to speak on the floor to employees so long as it didn't affect business. When Mr. Thornton refused to move his meeting, the manager called the police, at which point he said he would rather get arrested than change how he did his job. Mr. Thornton was handcuffed and placed briefly in a holding cell; although all charges were eventually dismissed.

Legal Points
False Arrest Claim: To succeed on his claim of false arrest, Mr. Thornton would need to show that he was detained for no legitimate reason. While the store was within its rights to ask him to follow some new rules, it seems that calling the police to have him arrested was an overly broad response if he was not being disruptive in the store.

Union Contract: The store had a right to change the way Mr. Thornton approached the employees, but to do so in a manner that caused him to be arrested may present problems. If Mr. Thornton was adhering to the store's rules up until that time, the strong reaction may be called into question.

Justification for Arrest: Being told to move to a back room wouldn't appear to be worthy of having the police called on him, unless Mr. Thornton was causing an actual disturbance or violating some specific law. Since the charges were dismissed, that would lead one to believe the police perhaps viewed the incident as a misunderstanding more than a criminal action.

WYSIATI (What You See Is All There Is)
WYSIATI—""What You See Is All There Is""—may make us judge the situation right away, off of the more dramatic elements. A person in handcuffs inside a store is wrong and unfair in itself, so we may easily accept that Mr. Thornton was treated badly. This visceral, immediate reaction may be overriding a more considered view as to whether the store had valid reasons for their actions, or whether there were other ways to handle the situation without police involvement.

Therefore, while Mr. Thornton may have a claim in his favour if he can prove that this was not a valid arrest, it is essential to look further than the obvious, emotionally-based parameters of this case to learn from it.",10,,,9,100.0,8

","**Is Mr. Thornton Right in Suing Thrifty Drug Store?**

Mr. Thornton may have a valid case for suing Thrifty Drug Store for false arrest, depending on the specific legal circumstances and the interpretation of the relevant laws. False arrest occurs when a person is unlawfully detained without proper legal authority or justification.

*Union Contract and Established Practice:*
   - Mr. Thornton was performing his duties as a union field representative, and the union contract allowed him to speak to union employees in the store, albeit in a designated area (the back room).
   - However, the contract provision requiring him to meet employees in a back room had never been enforced before, suggesting that there may have been an established practice allowing him to speak to employees on the store floor.

*The Manager's Actions:*
   - The store manager's decision to suddenly enforce the back-room rule and threaten Mr. Thornton with arrest may be seen as an overreach, especially if Mr. Thornton was not disrupting business and was following established norms.
   - The arrest could be considered unlawful if the manager lacked proper grounds to accuse Mr. Thornton of trespassing, particularly if he was on the premises performing his legitimate duties as per the union contract.

*Police Involvement and Charges:*
   - The fact that Mr. Thornton was handcuffed and detained but later released without charges being pressed might strengthen his claim of false arrest.
   - The key legal question would revolve around whether the manager had the legal authority to enforce the rule in such a manner and whether the police acted appropriately based on the information provided by the manager.

**WYSIATI (What You See Is All There Is) and Its Influence:**

In this case, WYSIATI might cause us to accept Mr. Thornton's narrative as true for the following reasons:

1. *Limited Information:*
   - The scenario provided offers a detailed account from Mr. Thornton's perspective but lacks the store manager's side of the story or any additional context, such as the reasons for suddenly enforcing the back-room rule.
   - Without questioning the completeness of the information, one might quickly conclude that Mr. Thornton's actions were entirely justified and that the arrest was unwarranted.

2. *Sympathy for the Plaintiff:*
   - The narrative emphasizes Mr. Thornton's long-standing routine and the abrupt change in enforcement, which might evoke sympathy and lead us to believe that the store's actions were unreasonable.
   - WYSIATI might cause us to overlook the possibility that there were valid reasons for the store's decision that we are not aware of.

3. *Legal and Moral Assumptions:*
   - Based on the information presented, one might assume that the store manager's actions were legally questionable and morally wrong, leading to an automatic acceptance of Mr. Thornton's right to sue.
   - WYSIATI might prevent us from considering alternative legal perspectives or the complexities of the union contract.

In summary, while Mr. Thornton might have a case for false arrest, WYSIATI could lead us to accept his account too readily without critically assessing the broader context or considering other possible explanations for the store's actions.",10,,,8,100.0,9

","Mr. Thornton is most likely right in suing Thrifty Drug Store as it seems that his rights of union activity were violated when the store manager prevented him from speaking to employees on the store floor. In a democratic country like the US, workers have the right of collective bargaining and the freedom of association, which includes the right for union representatives to speak to employees in the workplace within reasonable parameters. The fact that the manager enforced a rule that had never been enforced before suggests a potential bias against union activity, which could be seen as a violation of Mr. Thornton's rights.

In conclusion, Mr. Thornton may indeed have grounds for a lawsuit for false arrest if the arrest lacked proper legal justification.

","SOLUTIONS:-

Yes, Mr. Thornton may have grounds to sue for false arrest. If the rule requiring him to speak to employees only in a back room had never been enforced before and was not communicated clearly in advance, his arrest could be seen as unjust. Additionally, if his actions did not disrupt business and he was following the established norms of his previous visits, the arrest could be interpreted as an overreach by the store's management.


WYSIATI might cause us to accept the situation as presented because we are provided with a detailed narrative from Mr. Thornton's perspective, emphasizing his long-standing practice and the sudden, seemingly arbitrary enforcement of a new rule. Since we are only given one side of the story and no contradictory information, our judgment may be biased towards accepting his actions as justified and the store's actions as unreasonable.",10,,,8,100.0,9
137,179,Critical Thinking 101,a759ab85-5601-4a10-982d-e88a1aa67f5f,"*On September 3, plaintiff David Thornton, a forty-three-year-old union field representative, was present in Thrifty Drug Store #168, performing a routine union visit. Within ten minutes of his arrival, a store manager confronted him and told him he could no longer speak with the union employees on the floor of the store. Instead, he would have to see them in a back room while they were on break. Such a request is allowed by the union contract with Thrifty Drug but had never before been enforced. When Mr. Thornton objected, he was told that he had the choice of abiding by the rules, leaving the store, or being arrested. At this point, Mr. Thornton indicated to the manager that he had always been allowed to speak to employees on the floor for as much as ten minutes, as long as no business was disrupted, and that he would rather be arrested than change the procedure of his routine visit. The manager then called the police and had Mr. Thornton handcuffed in the store for trespassing. After he was booked and put into a holding cell for a brief time, all charges were dropped. Mr. Thornton is suing Thrifty Drug for false arrest.*

**Can you think why WYSIATI causes us to accept this as true?** 
","[{""solution"": ""\nMr. Thornton sued Thrifty Drug after being arrested during a routine visit for trespassing. He disagreed with the manager's request to speak with union employees in a back room instead of on the store floor. The manager called the police when Thornton refused.

","Here are five original examples designed to illustrate the conjunction fallacy, where people may choose the more specific scenario even though it is statistically less likely:

### Example 1: 
**Sophia is very tech-savvy, frequently posts about new gadgets on social media, and attends tech conferences regularly. Sophia is most likely to be a) a software engineer or b) a software engineer who has been featured in technology magazines?**

- **Explanation**: While Sophia being a software engineer is more likely, the additional detail of being featured in technology magazines makes option B seem more specific and appealing.

### Example 2:
**David loves to read fantasy novels, often dresses in medieval-themed clothing, and frequently attends fantasy book conventions. David is most likely to be a) a fantasy book author or b) a fantasy book author who has won multiple literary awards?**

- **Explanation**: David is more likely to be a fantasy book author (option A), but the added detail of winning multiple literary awards (option B) can seem more fitting based on the description.

### Example 3:
**Emily is an avid runner, trains rigorously every day, and participates in marathons. Emily is most likely to be a) a marathon runner or b) a marathon runner who has completed several international marathons?**

- **Explanation**: The more general category, being a marathon runner (option A), is statistically more probable than the more specific category of having completed several international marathons (option B).

### Example 4:
**Jack has a background in environmental science, volunteers for local conservation projects, and frequently talks about climate change. Jack is most likely to be a) an environmental consultant or b) an environmental consultant who is also a published author on climate change?**

- **Explanation**: Jack is more likely to be an environmental consultant (option A), as the additional detail of being a published author (option B) is less common and more specific.

### Example 5:
**Lily enjoys baking, has a large collection of cookbooks, and frequently posts recipes online. Lily is most likely to be a) a home baker or b) a professional baker who runs a popular baking blog?**

Sarah loves animals, she is an active volunteer in animal shelters, she has a number of household pets, and she is known for being passionate about animal welfare. Sarah is most likely:
a) a veterinarian
b) a veterinarian who specializes in exotic pets 

Choice B reflects a specific detail in the prompt, so people may pick it, but choice A is still statistically more likely.

a) a travel blogger
b) a travel blogger who reviews luxury resorts 

Again, specific details in the prompt may influence people to pick answering choice B, but still choice A is statistically more likely or true.

Additionally, I feared that leaving the job would be seen as admitting failure or a lack of perseverance to my friends, family, and professional network.\n\nOvercoming the Bias:\nI eventually overcame the commitment bias by objectively evaluating my situation.

Initially, the investment performed well, but after a while, the startup faced significant challenges and its value began to decline.

Additionally, I was influenced by the sunk cost fallacy, where I focused more on the money already invested rather than the future potential of the startup.\n\nFailing to Overcome the Bias:\nI couldn't overcome the bias because I allowed my emotions to cloud my judgment. Despite receiving advice from financial advisors to cut my losses, I remained hopeful that the startup would recover. My unwillingness to accept the loss and the fear of admitting a mistake prevented me from making a rational decision.

","1.It was difficult to stay with people who didn't share my ideals, and it made me more aware of how commitment bias affected my social life. I had spent a lot of time and emotional energy creating these friendships, so at first I felt a great sense of duty to keep them going. I had known these individuals for a long time, so the idea of losing that relationship was unsettling. But as time went on, I noticed that there was a big difference in our ideals. Their actions and attitudes frequently left me feeling exhausted and unsupported.

I was uncomfortable with the shift, but I was afraid of losing my social group, so I was hesitant to take it. Even though I recognised it was having a detrimental effect on my wellbeing, my loyalty to them kept me attached.
I gradually turned my attention to these more constructive influences. I took the effort to cultivate friendships with people that encouraged me and agreed with my values. Although this change was difficult for me, it was essential for my mental well-being.

2.My attachment bias, which was based on both sentimentality and monetary commitment, was evident in my decision to hang onto old clothing. My closet filled up with a variety of things over the years that didn't fit my tastes or style at the time. I became convinced that I should retain each item ""just in case"" I might wear it again because it brought back memories and reminded me of earlier wardrobe decisions.

I hesitated to declutter my wardrobe even though I knew I wore certain pieces rarely, if at all. This attachment resulted in a disorganised area that mirrored a look I no longer connected with. But as I started to think about my sense of style and how important clothes are for expressing oneself, I saw that these clothes were actually limiting me. They were no longer a reflection of my identity or my desired look.

I finally decided to give these clothes away. It was a freeing process for me to make room for the works that really spoke to who I am now. I learnt from this experience that sometimes going forward means letting go of old obligations to make place for development and new opportunities.

3.An impact on my wellbeing and how I felt about food. I started this stringent diet with the intention of reaching my health objectives. I was drawn to its promises of rapid results and a methodical approach to weight loss because I'm a control freak. But as time went on, the plan's rigidity started to wear thin. I started to feel cheated and angry, and I started to crave the foods I had given up.

Even with these bad emotions,... I felt that following the plan was an indication of my strength of character, and giving up would be an admission of failure. This way of thinking kept me stuck in a vicious cycle of restriction and guilt, which made me binge and eat emotionally.
I eventually realised that my strategy was harmful to my general wellbeing in addition to being unsustainable. I came to see that balance and fun didn't have to be sacrificed in order to reach health objectives. I made the decision to go to a more adaptable and well-rounded strategy that stressed moderation above restriction and incorporated a range of meals. This change changed my connection with food and enhanced my physical health. I developed a better, more sustainable lifestyle that matched my principles and long-term objectives by learning to enjoy meals guilt-free",10,"The answer provides relevant situations where commitment bias is evident and describes the context of each situation.

so if I have to talk of a time I initially was trapped in the commitment bias I don’t have to travel very back in time because there was a PPT presentation task that was assigned 3 weeks ago in Kalvium wherein I was committed to suggesting my team member to use this editing tool for that task. A few days later, may be 4-5, I learned about another new tool which was more easy to use, efficient and much more better than the previous editor and was suitable for our purposes. But instead I felt that I have to stay with the previous tool which could be as well a very wrong decision on my part. So it was the time when I remembered the existence of commitment bias. I thought I would be extremely nervous to switch to the new tool no matter how much time I invested to master that previous tool. Just thinking about this was a blow to my confidence, besides, I was very much aware that replacing tools mid-project would not only affect my task but could also slow my team down and confuse them. But finally I choose what is good for my team and our project. Next, I agreed, and on the same note informed all my team members that it would be unwise to hold unto the previous tool since it would slow every process. When they listen to it is not possible and thought of the general, more increased and future success of that particular task I decided that bigger picture of that switch. The other thing is that though it was not very easy to let go of the initial decision, trust me, it was for the best and that’s why the project in the end, ran much more smoothly.

solution of case:-2

So, if I talk about the second case, I was in my home city 1.5 years ago. A good example would be getting a membership for a certain gym that I thought was good, cheap and had everything I wanted at the time. To begin with, that form of convenience improved my desire and commitment to go to that particular gym, and exercise in order to reduce my size. But after few days I found that the gym was far from my home and I had tough time to go to that particular gym daily which wasted lot of productive time. And one more thing was that the gym I joined didn’t have the equipment or machines I was used to using. A few days later I found out that there is another gym five minutes away from me, all of the machines are the ones I have listed above, but for days I did not cross over from my regular gym to the new one. Here, I realized that another type of the commitment bias – decisions made after losing money or investing some time are the best ones in my mind – had an impact on my decision. I still reminded myself that I should stay with the previous resolution saying that I would adapt to that specific gym as time passed by. I did not want to demolish my initial payment that I made to the prior gym, that is why I remained attending the prior gym even though the vigor and encouragement for exercising began to wane. But for the sake of God I was able to understand that I was trying to make all sort of excuses in order to justify my decision on the previous investment. I had taken my time and finally switched to the new gym, this was the best decision ever. I realized that I was much more motivated to go workout on a regimen basis because I came across with the things wanted. In retrospect, I should not have allowed commitment bias rule me for this long into thinking that the earlier investment was the best thing, which was far from the truth.after that i was able to realize that its okay to change my mind on what is more relevant to me.this makes me achieve a more satisfying and fulfilling fitness regimen.

Context: I had passionately supported a political candidate during an election campaign. Over time, they become aware of unethical behavior or controversial actions taken by the candidate, but they struggle to change their opinion or support.
Why the Bias Occurred: Strong feelings for the candidate based on their previous promises and the alignment with personal values create a reluctance to acknowledge flaws and supporting the candidate may be tied to a broader social or political group, making it difficult to separate personal beliefs from group loyalty. Admitting that my candidate is not ideal can lead to uncertainty about their political choices and a need to think about my beliefs.
Overcoming the Bias: Engaged with different viewpoints to challenge their beliefs and encourage open-mindedness.

Years ago I had undertaken a personal project to create my own website. Initially enthusiastic, as I began making progress in the project, however, I started to realize that the project was much more time and skills intensive than I had ever imagined. I know this situation, except that, as far as I can see, I possess only a quite limited technical ability, holds me back. However, having reached such points, I had little choice but to carry on, even though I felt I was wasting my own time and effort. This is where commitment bias comes in. I continued with the project because I was so committed to it rather than reassessing the situation and taking a more rational decision.

I thought that quitting was a way of admitting that all my precious time and resources were a waste of time. In my head, quitting equalled failure. I was able to turn the issue around by stepping back and making a rational judgment about the whole thing; then it suddenly dawned upon me that it was a waste of frustration if I went on; instead, I could learn the techniques concerned first. Shifting from doing the project at all cost to improving my skills set freed me up to let go of the original commitment and make a more logical choice.

Situational Example 2: Remaining in a stale friendship

Several years ago, I continued to have a long-term friendship with two people whom we no longer had much in common. Though I knew them for many years, we didn't have much to talk about anymore; yet I continued to invest so much time in this friendship. Commitment bias occurred simply because I felt I owed it to both of us to maintain the relationship for what we'd once shared, even though it no longer fulfilled that purpose.

This could not be overcome as I was disturbed by my friend's hurt feelings and over the loss of comfort that had resulted from such a long-term relationship. What is more, our history made it worthwhile to hold on to it even though the connection had been weakened. And that is why I continued to maintain the friendship even after I had made up my mind that friendship was no longer meaningful anymore, and commitment bias, as a matter of fact, makes it quite difficult to leave long-term investments when they no longer become useful for you.",10,The answer provides relevant situations where commitment bias is evident and explains the context of each situation clearly.

solution of case:-1

so if I have to talk of a time I initially was trapped in the commitment bias I don’t have to travel very back in time because there was a PPT presentation task that was assigned 3 weeks ago in Kalvium wherein I was committed to suggesting my team member to use this editing tool for that task. A few days later, may be 4-5, I learned about another new tool which was more easy to use, efficient and much more better than the previous editor and was suitable for our purposes. But instead I felt that I have to stay with the previous tool which could be as well a very wrong decision on my part. So it was the time when I remembered the existence of commitment bias. I thought I would be extremely nervous to switch to the new tool no matter how much time I invested to master that previous tool. Just thinking about this was a blow to my confidence, besides, I was very much aware that replacing tools mid-project would not only affect my task but could also slow my team down and confuse them. But finally I choose what is good for my team and our project. Next, I agreed, and on the same note informed all my team members that it would be unwise to hold unto the previous tool since it would slow every process. When they listen to it is not possible and thought of the general, more increased and future success of that particular task I decided that bigger picture of that switch. The other thing is that though it was not very easy to let go of the initial decision, trust me, it was for the best and that’s why the project in the end, ran much more smoothly.

solution of case:-2

So, if I talk about the second case, I was in my home city 1.5 years ago. A good example would be getting a membership for a certain gym that I thought was good, cheap and had everything I wanted at the time. To begin with, that form of convenience improved my desire and commitment to go to that particular gym, and exercise in order to reduce my size. But after few days I found that the gym was far from my home and I had tough time to go to that particular gym daily which wasted lot of productive time. And one more thing was that the gym I joined didn’t have the equipment or machines I was used to using. A few days later I found out that there is another gym five minutes away from me, all of the machines are the ones I have listed above, but for days I did not cross over from my regular gym to the new one. Here, I realized that another type of the commitment bias – decisions made after losing money or investing some time are the best ones in my mind – had an impact on my decision. I still reminded myself that I should stay with the previous resolution saying that I would adapt to that specific gym as time passed by. I did not want to demolish my initial payment that I made to the prior gym, that is why I remained attending the prior gym even though the vigor and encouragement for exercising began to wane. But for the sake of God I was able to understand that I was trying to make all sort of excuses in order to justify my decision on the previous investment. I had taken my time and finally switched to the new gym, this was the best decision ever. I realized that I was much more motivated to go workout on a regimen basis because I came across with the things wanted. In retrospect, I should not have allowed commitment bias rule me for this long into thinking that the earlier investment was the best thing, which was far from the truth.after that i was able to realize that its okay to change my mind on what is more relevant to me.this makes me achieve a more satisfying and fulfilling fitness regimen.",10,"The answer provides relevant situations where commitment bias occurred and explains the context of each situation clearly.

### Situation 1: Work Project Commitment

**Context:**  
I was part of a team working on a project with a tight deadline. Early on, I volunteered to take on a significant portion of the work, believing it would showcase my skills. As the project progressed, it became clear that the workload was heavier than anticipated, and I started to feel overwhelmed.

**Why the Bias Occurred:**  
The commitment bias kicked in because I had already publicly committed to this role. I didn’t want to let my team down or appear unreliable. Additionally, the longer I worked on the project, the more I felt that I had to see it through, even if it meant sacrificing my well-being.

**Overcoming the Bias:**  
I eventually recognized the toll it was taking on me. I scheduled a team meeting to discuss the project’s progress and expressed my concerns about my workload. To my surprise, my teammates were supportive and offered to redistribute some tasks. By openly communicating, I was able to lighten my load and refocus on my contributions without the burden of commitment bias.

### Situation 2: Gym Membership

**Context:**  
I signed up for a gym membership with a two-year commitment, excited to kickstart my fitness journey. Initially, I went regularly, but as the novelty wore off, I found myself skipping sessions more frequently. I still had over a year left on my contract.

**Why the Bias Occurred:**  
The commitment bias led me to continue feeling obligated to go to the gym, even when my motivation waned. I thought about the money I had already invested and felt guilty about not utilizing the membership fully.

**Overcoming the Bias:**  
In this case, I struggled to overcome the bias. Instead of accepting my changing priorities, I tried to force myself to attend the gym, but it only led to frustration. Eventually, I recognized that my interests had shifted toward outdoor activities, but by then, I felt stuck in the contract. I learned a lesson about aligning commitments with genuine interests, but I couldn’t change the situation until the membership expired. 

These situations highlighted how commitment bias can influence decision-making and the importance of being adaptable in response to changing circumstances.

Certainly! Here’s a more detailed exploration of each situation, along with explicit reflections on the lessons learned.

### Situation 1: Work Project Commitment

**Context:**  
During my time at a tech startup, our team was tasked with developing a new feature for our app within a tight three-month deadline. I volunteered to lead the design aspect because I was eager to prove myself and showcase my creativity. In the initial stages, I worked diligently, brainstorming ideas and coordinating with team members. However, as we delved deeper into the project, unforeseen complexities arose. I began to feel overwhelmed by both my responsibilities and the feedback loop with stakeholders, which led to increased pressure.

**Why the Bias Occurred:**  
The commitment bias emerged strongly as I had publicly declared my commitment to leading the design. I feared that if I admitted I was struggling, I would appear unreliable to my colleagues. This fear of judgment and desire to maintain my initial commitment led me to push through, even when it became counterproductive. I was caught in a cycle of thinking that I had to see it through to the end, despite my rising stress levels.

**Overcoming the Bias:**  
Realizing that my health and the quality of the project were at stake, I decided to confront the situation head-on. I scheduled a team meeting to openly discuss our progress and the challenges I faced. To my relief, my team was incredibly supportive; several members offered to help with specific tasks. This collaborative approach not only alleviated my workload but also fostered a sense of teamwork and accountability. 

**Lessons Learned:**  
I learned the importance of communication and transparency in collaborative environments. By acknowledging my struggles, I created space for others to offer support, reinforcing that we’re all in it together. Additionally, I recognized that it’s okay to recalibrate commitments as projects evolve; flexibility can lead to better outcomes for both individuals and teams.

### Situation 2: Gym Membership

**Context:**  
After a long period of inactivity, I decided to invest in my health and signed a two-year contract at a local gym. Initially, I was enthusiastic and went regularly, attending classes and trying new workouts. However, as the months passed, my enthusiasm waned. I began to dread the gym and found myself skipping workouts in favor of outdoor activities, like hiking and cycling, which I enjoyed much more.

**Why the Bias Occurred:**  
The commitment bias kicked in as I felt trapped by the financial investment I had made. Each month I paid for the membership, I felt compelled to justify that expense by forcing myself to use the gym, even when my interest was elsewhere. I thought about how much I had spent and feared wasting money if I didn’t utilize the membership fully.

**Overcoming the Bias:**  
Despite my growing discontent, I struggled to overcome the commitment bias. I attempted to force myself to go to the gym, but it only led to feelings of frustration and guilt. I realized that I wasn’t being true to my interests. It wasn’t until I spoke with friends who had similar experiences that I understood the importance of aligning commitments with genuine passions. However, I felt too committed to my contract to change course until it expired.

**Lessons Learned:**  
This situation taught me the significance of aligning commitments with my true interests and passions. I learned that financial investments do not justify continuing a path that no longer serves me. Reflecting on my preferences helped me to better assess future commitments, whether it’s a gym membership or a project at work. In the end, it reinforced the idea that sometimes, letting go of a commitment can open the door to more fulfilling experiences.

1.I joined a club in college that only focused on skits. At first, I was excited but as time passed I realized I didn’t enjoyed acting as much as I thought i could. I felt really bad because I already had committments with the club and I had participated in a some of the performances. I don't want to be known as a quitter and also did not wanted that the club says that i'm a liar because i was planning to leave it. After thinking about it. I wrote my feelings on a paper and realised what all i was doing and started thinking about it all.I felt that i should not continue it further. I discussed it with the club leader and they also understood my feeelings and suggested me if I could help them in behind the scene works instead.I was involved with the club .Similarly i did not had the feeling that i have to act when i am not in the mood to act,or act as a formality just pecaused i had signed up with them.This is how i dealt with commitment bias here.

2.I signed up in a gym for a 75 days fitness challenge and convinced myself that it would help me to get fit and in shape in 75 days. After a month I realized I wasn’t enjoying the workouts and I'm interested in yoga. I felt like I have already spent a lot of time and money into it and quitting seemed like a big mistake that i can not stick to a decision. I continued the challenge even when i was not happy and told myself to buck up myself because i do not wanted to waste my commitments.I discussed this all with my gym trainer and he understood my feelings and told me that i shold just give it a chance for once .Then i tried the challenge while trying to ennoy it rather than thinking that i cannot do it and i saw myself getting in shape and that became my motivation and i completed the challenge of 75 days and i continued it for 100 days.This how i deal with my commitment bias.

My last year at college also allowed me to participate in a group project aimed at creating a marketing plan for a local business. I would soon become the leader because I wanted to prove my abilities and climb the ranks in class. Then I realized my peers were not contributing as significantly to the project as I was. A commitment bias-and I felt tied to my earlier statement and should maintain the lead: could not now really come out and discuss the imbalances. I feared looking unreliable, disappointing my group.

I finally killed this prejudice by having a frank discussion with my team members on the workload. I proposed to reassess our roles according to individual strengths and interests. That decongested me without burdening others further; it encouraged them to own up as well. A better collaborative work benefited the project and led to a more solid final presentation.

Situation 2: Gym Membership Commitment
I joined a gym on a two-year contract simply because I wanted to be seen as fit and healthy, for real. Honestly, at first, I was really kind of enthusiastic, but as the months went by, I found it quite challenging really to maintain that schedule of working out consistently. This notwithstanding, I was reluctant to cancel my membership because I felt financially I had spent so much already. It was commitment bias that attached me to the gym, even when it no longer suited my lifestyle.

Here, I could not overcome the bias. I convinced myself that whatever I had invested thus far was not going to waste, which only chained me further to my commitments. It wasn't until I realized my mental well-being was suffering from the stress of being tied to something I wasn't using that I finally decided to reevaluate my commitment.

Context: A few years ago, I got really into photography as a hobby. I invested a lot of money in equipment, spent weekends going to different places to take photos, and even enrolled in a few online courses. Over time, I realized I wasn't enjoying it as much as I used to. But because I had already invested so much time and money, I felt like I had to keep pursuing it.

Why the bias occurred: I was caught in commitment bias because I didn’t want to feel like I had wasted all the money and time I had already put in. There was also a bit of fear of what people would think if I just stopped after talking about it so much.

Overcame the bias: After reflecting, I realized that my initial interest in photography had faded and that forcing myself to continue wasn't bringing me any joy. I shifted my focus to another hobby I was genuinely passionate about. It helped to recognize that it was okay to let go of things that weren’t serving me anymore, even if I had invested in them before. That understanding allowed me to move on without guilt.

Situation 2: Sticking with a Project That Wasn’t Working
Context: At work, I once started a project that seemed promising in the beginning. I put in a lot of hours, but after a few weeks, it became clear that it wasn’t going to achieve the results we expected. I felt like if I just kept pushing, I could make it work, despite the obvious signs that it wasn’t going anywhere.

Why the bias occurred: I was stuck because I had already put in so much effort, and abandoning the project felt like admitting failure. I didn’t want all the time and energy spent to go to waste, so I kept working on it even though it wasn’t productive.

Couldn't overcome the bias: I wasn’t able to overcome the bias at the time because I didn’t want to let down my team or admit defeat. I kept convincing myself that with just a little more effort, things would turn around. It wasn’t until much later, when I spoke with my manager, that I realized it would’ve been smarter to cut my losses earlier and focus on something more worthwhile.

These examples highlight how commitment bias can show up in different areas of life, whether personal or professional, and the challenges involved in recognizing and addressing it.

There was a time when I committed to reading a long book that everyone seemed to love. I had heard great things, so I bought it and started reading. About a third of the way in, I realized I wasn’t enjoying it at all. The plot felt slow, the characters didn’t resonate with me, but I kept reading, thinking, ""I’ve already spent so much time on this, I should just finish it.""

The commitment bias was strong here because I didn’t want to feel like I had wasted my time. I thought abandoning the book halfway would mean admitting I made a bad choice, and I kept hoping it would get better.

Why I Couldn't Overcome the Bias: In this case, I didn’t manage to overcome the bias. I pushed myself to finish the book, and by the end, I regretted not putting it down earlier. I learned that forcing myself through something just because I started it doesn’t always pay off, but at the time, the idea of quitting felt worse than enduring something I didn’t enjoy.

Situation 2: Sticking with a Side Project

I once started a side project with a group of friends to build an app. At first, we were all excited and had big ideas about its potential. But as we progressed, it became clear that our goals were misaligned, and the scope of the project was way bigger than we anticipated. Communication between the team members started breaking down, and the project wasn’t moving forward.

The commitment bias hit because we had already invested time and energy into the project. I didn’t want to back out, especially since I had a personal connection with the team, and I didn’t want to let anyone down. Even though I could see that the project wasn’t going anywhere, I stuck with it much longer than I should have.

How I Overcame the Bias: After months of slow progress and constant frustration, I took a step back and had an honest conversation with the team. We collectively realized that our commitment was based more on the time and effort we had already put in, rather than whether the project was still viable. Once we recognized that, we agreed to scale it back and focus on more manageable tasks. Letting go of the original vision was tough, but it felt like a relief once we made the decision. This helped us refocus, and I felt like we made a smart move rather than being dragged down by an old commitment.",10,"The answer demonstrates a clear understanding of commitment bias and provides relevant situations with sufficient context and description.

-
i was using a soap from a specific brand for like 3-4 months to treat tanning and acne , even when noticing no results , i kept using it because i loved that brand and was more familiar with its scent , and truting on their ads . 

-  **Why this bias happened ?**
 
I had trusted this soap to work too, as I have a good experience with another product from the same brand..

- **Familiarity:** I get so used to how it smells and its routine that it becomes quite challenging to try something else.. and if tried i feared that it may damage my skin much more.

- **Influence of Advertisements:**
 Ads assured me that this soap was effective for tanning and acne, which is pretty strong in giving me commitment towards it despite not-so-good results that surfaced.


- **Results:**

 - Wasted time:
 Used the soap for months, expecting one day that results would be seen; skin problems continued and probably worsened until a suitable replacement was used.

-  Positive Change: Switched to moisturizing soap, skin improved ; thus, emphasizes the importance of choosing the right product rather than brand loyalty.

#2.   Not Upgrading My Old Phone
-

I was using a old phone, one that overheats and lags and has  blurred camera . Online payments are quite challenging to execute from this rusty phone. Hard as I tried to upgrade because I had already spent money on repairs and mostly worked on my laptop. It was too hard to use; the new one had better features and security.

 - **Why the Bias Occurred:**



- **Sunk Cost Fallacy:** As I had spent a lot of money restoring my phone, I felt that I was bound to continue using it instead of purchasing a new one. 

-  **Usage Habits:**  Since most of my time is spent working on my laptop, I convinced myself that issues with my phone were not an emergency issue. I wouldn't incur the cost of a new phone, and it increasingly became important to get one.

-  **Results:**

The overheating and time-consuming lags made the phone unusable for minor activities like online payments. The delay in accessing the required software updates and security components with the old phone was a disadvantage. 

- **Better Experience after Upgrade:** I really enjoyed working on an upgraded phone where performance and seamless updated security features gave an edge towards more productivity and convenience at work.",10,"The answer demonstrates a clear understanding of commitment bias in both situations.

I enrolled in an online course to learn a new language. Initially, I was enthusiastic and dedicated to my studies. However, as the weeks went by, I realized that I wasn’t enjoying the material and was struggling to keep up with the pace.

Why the Bias Occurred: I had already invested a significant amount of time and money into the course, and I didn’t want to feel like I had wasted that investment. The thought of quitting felt like admitting defeat.

Outcome: After some reflection, I decided to evaluate my reasons for wanting to learn the language. I realized that the course structure didn’t suit my learning style. I eventually chose to quit the course and sought out language-learning apps and informal groups instead. This shift felt empowering, as I was able to engage with the language in a way that truly interested me.

Both situations highlight the importance of recognizing when to reassess commitments and prioritize what genuinely fulfills us.

SITUATION 2)-

Why the Bias Occurred: I felt stuck because I had already paid for the membership and didn’t want to admit I wasn’t using it. Plus, I didn’t want to let my friends down.

Situation 1: Holding  a wrong Investment:

Context: It is a tech startup investment. The company had been pitched decently upon initially reviewing reports and market potential. There wasn't a decent showing of the company for three years in a row, and the firm seemed to be doing worse than its earlier years. They always missed target marks but the warnings from financial advisors and other investors were always ignored because optimism is what's keeping me hopeful that this company will revive.

Why the Bias Was Observed: Commitment bias was based on the money and emotional investment already made. I did not want to sell the shares as it felt like a defeat; the psychological problem was that I could not accept the loss. I thought that if I held on for a little longer, the market would turn, and I would recover my investment.

Outcome: I failed to realize the bias in time and kept the equity shares too long. The company went bankrupt, and I lost all my investment completely. Now, in hindsight, what I was more keen on was not accepting the loss rather than trying to see the factual performance of the company. Emotions of the first decision managed to cloud my judgment.

Situation 2: Learning a skill which I was not intersted in:

Background: I dedicated a large portion of my early career learning a highly in-demand programming language. I acquired my skill in it, but, in hindsight, I often found that the passion was missing from writing applications code, and my task felt so mundane. But I continued placing myself up for jobs and projects in this discipline purely because I had spent considerable time mastering the skill.

Why this Prejudice Emerged: I had to protect the investment of time, energy, and resources put into learning this language. There was an aspect of sunk cost; giving up seemed like a waste of all that already done. Fearful also of starting over in another study area as well.

Change of Bias When I reached that stage and was there for some time, I had a mentor sit me down and ask me to focus more on my long-term goals than the previous investments that had failed. So, I stopped and reflected on what I would love doing. That helped me to change to a completely new career where the interest aligned with my strengths. Although it meant a change in learned behaviors, the reward that was received was well worth the change.

In both of these cases, there could not have been a deeper feeling of emotional involvement in the previous attempts; however, there arose a realization of the long-term effects and outside support that aided the first case, but another lost what was there because of being unable to let go.",10,The answer demonstrates a clear understanding of commitment bias in both situations and provides relevant contexts for each.

I was working in a team of a new software application. Initially, I was enthusiastic and fully committed and gave full contributions in terms of ideas and responsibilities. Over time, though, I became convinced that we were headed in the wrong direction and that there were tremendous technical problems. Though I hesitated to express my concerns. The commitment bias already emerged too late because I had applied too much time and effort, so I wasn't even ready to step back in, out of fear of undermining my teammates' efforts and the overall achievement of the project.

It needed just a self-withdrawal from the situation, a disengagement, and then going through all that was necessary. But, with a bit of desperation, I even organized a team meeting where we could, in a frank and openly honest manner, discuss our general progress and concerns. As I presented my input this time framing it as an opportunity for collaboration rather than criticism, I kind of nudged others as well to share their thoughts too. This again led to a constructive discussion and in the end we concluded to pivot our approach. So addressing this bias has allowed us greatly to better the project significantly and turn all our efforts towards alignment.

Commitment to Gym Membership

I committed to a membership to a gym for an entire year because I would really like to be fit. I was very excited at the start, attending classes often, but within a few months I lost the excitement and eventually stopped going to class so often. I felt bad about the unused membership, yet could not complete the canceling process. The commitment bias was particularly strong in this case-it is always a massive upfront payment, and quitting feels like money is being wasted.

In this case, I could not easily get over my bias. Though I knew I was not actively using membership, thinking about to submit to defeat became a limiter in abandoning it. I tried other ways to work out; perhaps that would excite me to regain interest, but my commitment kept me held to a choice that had long since stopped helping me. Eventually, I did cancel my membership; however, it took longer than it should have, and that was because of the emotional weight of my initial commitment clouded judgment.

Scenario 1: Work Project

I was part of a group commissioned to develop a new software application. I started out motivated and highly committed, brainstorming concepts and working with substantial responsibilities. As the project went along, I thought we were not doing things efficiently enough and that we indeed hit pretty major technical challenges. I did not raise it. Now, commitment bias overwhelmed me; I had sunk so far into the work that to reverse all that was too much to risk jeopardizing everything that my teammates and others had worked for and the project in general.

To overcome this commitment bias, I made a decision to go back and re-evaluate things. I called for a meeting by the team so that we could effectively air out our progress and our concerns for one another. Worded input so that the other could also give his opinion instead of doling out criticisms, I encouraged discussion. We eventually changed course. We removed bias and were able to achieve some crucial improvements with the project and realign our efforts better.

Situation 2: Gym Membership Commitment

I joined a one-year gym membership entirely for getting fit. Initially, I was keen on joining classes; however, after some months, it just wasn't possible and I hardly went there. On the other hand, I still felt bad over the fact that I wasted my membership subscription but nothing that would make me cancel it. In this case, commitment bias was strong as, having paid a lot upfront, I felt I wasted the money if I quit.

I could not win over the bias in this situation. Even though I was aware of the fact that I was not using it to my advantage, the feeling of losing does not make people give up; thus, I held on to it. I tried to change gears by finding different forms of activity to fall in love with again, but some prior commitments tied them to a decision that no longer worked for them. Eventually I did cancel my membership, but too long a period had elapsed for the emotional attachment I had to the decision I made initially refused me the spur to act in my best interest.",10,The answer demonstrates a clear understanding of commitment bias and provides relevant situations where the bias occurred.

1. One common stereotype is that women are more nurturing and better suited for caregiving roles, while men are seen as more assertive and suited for leadership roles. 
2. Older adults are sometimes stereotyped as being out of touch with technology or resistant to change, while younger people might be seen as inexperienced or overly idealistic. 
3. There are also stereotypes about personal traits, such as the belief that introverted people are shy and not social, while extroverted people are seen as outgoing and socially skilled. 
4. People often have stereotypes about certain professions. For instance, there’s a stereotype that all artists are poor or that engineers are socially awkward. These assumptions can influence perceptions of individuals based on their jobs.
5. There are stereotypes about various racial and ethnic groups, such as the belief that all Asians are good at math, or that all Latinos are involved in manual labor.

Exercise #6:

1. It's a common belief that goldfish have extremely short memories. However, research has shown that goldfish actually have a much longer memory span, capable of remembering things for weeks or even months.
2. This myth suggests that most of our brain's potential is unused. In reality, neuroscientific research shows that virtually all parts of the brain have some known function, and brain activity is widespread, even when we’re at rest.
3. There’s a belief that we consume large quantities of dirt through our food and environment. While it’s true that we ingest small amounts of soil, the figure of 1-2 pounds annually is exaggerated and misleading.
4.  This urban legend is widely circulated but has no scientific basis. The likelihood of swallowing spiders while sleeping is extremely low, and there’s no evidence supporting this claim.
5. It’s a common saying that lightning doesn’t hit the same place twice. In fact, lightning can and often does strike the same place more than once, especially if that place is a tall structure or a frequently struck area.

2. It was a common belief that the Great Wall of China is visible from space. Upon researching, I discovered that this is a myth. The wall is not visible to the naked eye from low Earth orbit without aid because it is relatively narrow and blends in with the natural terrain.
3.  I believed that the Kumbh Mela, a massive religious gathering in India, is visible from space. While the event is indeed large, it is not distinguishable from space in the way it is told to people however we cannot see it with naked eyes.

1. Men are Strong and the Sole Financial Supporters: In contemporary society, men are often perceived as the primary providers and the emotionally strong members of the family. However, this stereotype overlooks the fact that men also have emotions and vulnerabilities that need to be acknowledged and respected.
2. Women Lack Equal Opportunities: Despite significant progress, women in many regions still face unequal opportunities compared to men. Although there has been a notable increase in the number of working women and the opportunities available to them, many areas, especially in underdeveloped regions, still lag behind. 
3. All Asians are Studious and Hardworking: A common stereotype is that all Asians are more studious, smarter, and harder working than others. This generalization is false as individual capabilities vary widely, and not all Asians fit this description. 
4. Boys are Less Fragile than Girls: There is a belief that boys are inherently tougher and less fragile than girls. This stereotype ignores the fact that emotional and physical strength varies from person to person, regardless of gender. Both boys and girls can exhibit strength and vulnerability, and it is important to recognize and respect the individual differences among all children.
5. Women were Once Unable to Vote or Work in Many Professions: Up until the early 20th century, many people believed that women were incapable of participating in public life, such as voting or working in certain professions. While this belief was widely held, it was untrue and has been disproven by the significant advancements in women's rights and opportunities.

The wall is not visible to the naked eye from low Earth orbit without aid because it is relatively narrow and blends in with the natural terrain. 
3. Kumbh Mela Visible from Space: I believed that the Kumbh Mela, a massive religious gathering in India, is visible from space. While the event is indeed large, it is not distinguishable from space in the way often portrayed. Satellite images can capture large gatherings, but the notion that it is visibly significant from space is exaggerated.
4. Going Out with Wet Hair Makes You Sick: I used to think that going outside with wet hair would directly cause illness, particularly colds. However, this belief is based on a misconception. Illnesses like colds are caused by viruses, not cold weather or wet hair. While being cold and wet might weaken your immune system slightly, it does not directly cause sickness.

5 Stereotypical beliefs that I or people around me have held are as follows:

**1.Myth: Cutting nails in the evening or at night brings bad luck.**

People believe that cutting nails post-sunset brings bad luck, attributed to a supposed divine punishment. 

However, scientifically, nails are composed of dead skin cells and can harbor bacteria. Cutting them in dim light increases the risk of contamination.

**2.Myth: Women are not allowed to go to the temple during menstruation because they become impure.**

There's a belief that menstruating women are impure and should not enter temples due to spiritual reasons. 

Scientifically, menstruation involves hormonal changes that can affect energy levels and body rhythms, potentially disrupting rituals that require mental and physical harmony.

**3.Myth: Going out at night with open hair leads to possession by bad entities.**

It's believed that having open hair at night invites negative entities.

Scientifically, leaving hair loose can lead to tangling, breakage, or hair fall due to wind or physical activity.


**4.Myth: It is bad luck to see your face in a broken mirror.**

There's a superstition that seeing one's reflection in a broken mirror brings bad luck.

 Scientifically, the broken pieces of mirror are dangerous due to the risk of getting cut by sharp glass edges.

**5.Myth: Hanging lemon, green chillies, and mango leaves on the door wards off the evil eye.**

It's believed that these items protect against the evil eye. 

Scientifically, lemon, green chillies, and mango leaves have natural properties that repel insects, potentially protecting homes from pests without harm.

*Exercise #6:*


5 Things I believed to be true - but later found out to be false since I didn’t question them deeply enough the first time:

**1.Myth: Cancer is hereditary and you can only get cancer if it is inherited from your parents.**

Contrary to common belief, only a small percentage (5 to 10 percent) of cancers are directly inherited from parents. Most cancers result from genetic changes that accumulate over a person's lifetime.

**2.Myth: People's body type defines how much they eat.**

 Body type, such as ectomorphs, endomorphs, and mesomorphs, varies widely and does not dictate caloric intake. For example, ectomorphs may appear thin but can consume large amounts of food compared to endomorphs, who tend to have a different physique.

**3.Myth: Cutting a worm in half creates two living worms.**

Despite popular belief, cutting a worm in half typically results in only one surviving part. The section with the mouth and necessary organs may regenerate, while the other part usually does not survive.

**4.Myth: All kinds of water conduct electricity.**

Pure water, without impurities or ions, is actually a poor conductor of electricity. It's the impurities and ions in water that enable electrical conductivity.

**5.Myth: Eating junk foods or fast food helps underweight people gain weight.**

Weight gain is influenced by various factors including lifestyle, diet quality, and calorie intake. Simply consuming junk or fast food does not necessarily promote healthy weight gain or muscle development.",10,"The answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of both exercises and provides relevant and accurate examples for each.

While some older adults may find technology challenging, many are adept users who have adapted well to new devices through learning and practice. Age alone does not dictate technological proficiency.\n\n3. People who wear glasses are smarter: This belief suggests a correlation between wearing glasses and intelligence. However, eyewear is primarily related to vision correction, not intellectual capacity. Intelligence is a complex trait influenced by various factors beyond physical appearance or accessories.\n\n4. All teenagers are rebellious: This stereotype paints all teenagers as defiant and rebellious, which overlooks the diversity of personalities and behaviors among young people. While adolescence can involve exploration and boundary-testing, not all teenagers exhibit rebellious behavior to the same extent or in the same manner.\n\n5.

5 Stereotypical Beliefs

When lending or giving cash to someone, it is customary to use the right hand and avoid using the left hand. There is a belief that using the left hand is disrespectful.

Cutting nails after dawn is believed to increase one's debt.

People who do not lie are believed to live longer than those who lie.

Wearing black clothing is believed to emit a negative aura.

It is believed that one should not get haircuts on Tuesdays.

Exercise #6

Black: A Negative Color?
Many people believe that black is a negative color associated with sorrow and negativity. There's a stereotype that one shouldn't wear black to special occasions. I used to believe this, but it's not true. Black is simply a color, and the tradition of associating it with mourning was started by the Romans.

Haircuts on Tuesdays
There's a persistent belief that getting haircuts on Tuesdays is unlucky. People have no scientific explanation for this, but they fear it might lead to hair loss. I used to believe this, but upon reflection, it's not true.

Right Hand for Lending Money
When giving someone cash, it's believed one should always use the right hand. Using the left hand is considered disrespectful. However, in practice, it doesn't matter which hand is used to give money.

Paranormal Activities at Midnight
Movies, series, and magazines often depict ghostly activities starting at midnight. There's a belief that going out after midnight may lead to encountering paranormal events. However, scientifically speaking, this belief is not proven.

People Who Speak Truth Live Longer?

 Imagine when you’re at a restaurant and the server seems inattentive or rude. You might think, “This server is unfriendly and doesn’t care about their job.”

Problem: This judgment reflects the Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE) because it attributes the server's behavior to their character without considering potential situational factors. Perhaps they are dealing with a difficult table, are under stress due to staff shortages, or had a personal issue that day. Misjudging their character could lead to an unpleasant interaction, negatively affect their performance, and create a hostile atmosphere in the restaurant.

Importance of Understanding and Avoiding FAE
Promotes Empathy: Understanding the FAE encourages us to consider the context behind people's actions. This can foster empathy, allowing us to approach situations with a more compassionate mindset rather than jumping to conclusions about someone's character.

Improves Communication: By avoiding quick judgments, we can engage in more constructive conversations. In the restaurant scenario, a more empathetic approach might involve speaking to the manager about the service rather than blaming the server, leading to better resolutions.

Enhances Relationships: Recognizing that behavior is often influenced by external factors helps in building stronger relationships, whether personal or professional. It encourages open-mindedness and understanding, reducing unnecessary conflicts and promoting collaboration.

**Traffic Incident**

 Imagine you’re driving and another driver cuts you off, forcing you to slam on the brakes. You might immediately think, “What a reckless and careless driver!”
  This reaction exemplifies the Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE) because it attributes the other driver’s behavior to their character, assuming they are simply irresponsible. However, they could be experiencing a personal emergency, dealing with an urgent situation, or even just making a momentary mistake. This misjudgment can lead to heightened anger and stress, increasing the likelihood of aggressive driving behavior and potential road rage.

her driver might be facing unknown challenges, you can maintain a calmer demeanor, reducing stress for you Understanding and Avoiding FAE  the FAE helps cultivate patience. By considering that the otrself and others on the road.

Reduces Conflict: Avoiding quick judgments can minimize aggressive responses and hostile interactions. In traffic situations, a more understanding mindset can prevent escalation, contributing to safer driving conditions.

Fosters a Culture of Understanding: When people collectively strive to avoid the FAE, it promotes a culture of understanding and compassion in society. This broader awareness encourages individuals to consider external factors in various situations, leading to improved interactions beyond driving.


**Academic Performance**


  A student receives a low grade on an exam. Teachers and peers might quickly assume, **“This student isn’t trying hard enough” or “They must not care about their studies.”**

 This response reflects the Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE) because it attributes the student’s performance to their character rather than considering possible situational factors. The student might be dealing with personal issues, such as family problems, mental health challenges, or external pressures that affect their ability to study effectively. Misjudging their situation can lead to a lack of support and understanding, further impacting the student’s motivation and academic performance.
 
 Understanding the FAE encourages educators and peers to seek context before making judgments. This approach fosters a more supportive environment where students feel safe discussing their challenges and seeking help.

Enhances Fair Assessments: By recognizing that various factors can influence academic performance, teachers can provide more equitable assessments and tailored support. This leads to better educational outcomes and helps students thrive.

  Acknowledging the FAE opens pathways for communication. Students who feel understood are more likely to express their concerns and seek guidance, leading to improved relationships with teachers and peers

The fundamental attribution error (FAE) is the tendency to overemphasize personality traits and underestimate situational factors when evaluating the behavior of others. This may result in wrong judgments by a person or individuals involved in passing judgments on the behavior, due to the fundamental attribution error. The outcome is that conclusions are drawn that do not represent the real truth. The bias marks wrong interpretations of behavior with significant effects in a workplace, school environments, or social and community settings.

Case Situation 1: Work-Related Conflicts
Employee-management relations in the workplace are rather subtle. Suppose one member of a manager's team is constantly missing deadlines. Her first judgment would be that the employee is lazy, disorganized, or simply not committed. This attribution results from committing the fundamental attribution error by ignoring situational factors that may have an influence on the conduct of the employee in question.

Possible situational factors: the employee may be facing personal issues, such as health problems, family duties, or even problems related to the work environment- incomplete instructions or a lack of resources, among others. Such aspects outside of the individual may be very influential in affecting an employee's performance.

Impact in the Workplace: If a manager perceives an employee's inability to meet deadlines as simply an indication of his or her character, it will produce an employee who feels misunderstood and unsupported. The assumption creates conditions that escalate stress levels, reduce morale, and may even promote turnover when the employee becomes too time-consuming to try and seek another workplace that is going to understand him or her better. The manager may also miss a chance to offer support or special accommodations that would enable an employee to perform appropriately thus trapping an employee in a cycle of poor performance.

Implications Bigger: Over time, such false attributions would begin to impact the organization's general culture. People may stay unwilling to express their problem or ask for help out of fear of judgment. This can lead to a failure of successful open communication, decreased collaboration, and ultimately decreasing productivity and innovation levels.

Situation 2: Social Interactions
Social situations most often heighten the impact of the fundamental attribution error. For instance, to consider the example given above, consider this scenario: it is a party in which one person is being rude by cutting off others during their speaking and seems non-interested. Most people will soon label the individual as inconsiderate or arrogant, without taking the situation into consideration.

Possible situational factors: There could be numerous situational factors that might be causing such rude behavior. It may arise due to social anxiety or an upsetting day in their life, or they could suffer from a neurodivergent condition with no knowledge of social norms. Such factors explain their behavior more than a judgment on their character.

Social Impact: The heady people who are in a hurry to judge with minimal observation push individuals who may be struggling with very narrow-minded conclusions. This creates an extremely hostile environment against anyone who will not conform to the set expectations, forcing appropriate relations further away. The condemned subject will only proceed to getting farther and away from the world, making it only absolutely true for him and them all will continue guessing.

Bigger Picture: Social relationships are relevant to individual well-being, and community building happens within these networks. The tendency of groups to exhibit this version of the fundamental attribution error will likely have the effect of unintentionally creating a culture of exclusion rather than support and understanding. Significant relationships will be difficult to form and can instead drive people to make assumptions that are negative about others who don't fit expected norms of behavior.

Situation 3: Academic Performance
The phenomenon of the fundamental attribution error can sometimes have very serious consequences in educational settings for students. Imagine a teacher who keeps seeing that a particular student always gets bad grades on tests. Such a teacher might then believe that the student is not making enough of an effort, or that he just doesn't have what it takes to understand the topic.

Situational Factors: There may be external situation influences of an unstable home environment, learning disabilities, or mental illness which may make the student inattentive and less able to perform well in class. The teacher may dismiss these situational factors and hence not provide the student with adequate mentorship and resources to aid in performance enhancement.

Impact on Student Outcomes: This may indirectly create a vicious cycle if the teacher thinks that this is a part of the character or the ability of the student. They will be demotivated by this, because they do not have any interest in engaging with the subject matter and then performance is going to be affected; perhaps this lowers self-esteem and develops a mindset that one is unable to perform certain tasks, which has a long-term effect on education.

The fundamental attribution error even has broader implications. It can shape the whole educational environment. A teacher who habitually tends to misinterpret student behavior can develop biases in his grading and personal relationships, treating some students different than others. It is a pitfall route toward systemic problems in education-categorizing groups of students into a given label instead of finding ways to let each student get support.

Why the Fundamental Attribution Error Matters to Know and Avoid
Understanding and reducing the basic attribution error is important for several reasons. It has implications for encouraging empathy. When we recognize that behavior is often driven by circumstantial factors outside of our control, we become much more empathetic in our interactions. When I understand other people have challenges with which I am unfamiliar, I find that I can be more compassionate and empathetic. The move from inside to outside can help us develop closer, more supportive relationships.

Improves Communication: The basic idea behind not committing the fundamental attribution error is to open avenues of better communication. Instead of deciding immediately about someone's personality, we can have discussions wherein we try to understand his point of view. This enables an atmosphere in which individuals feel comfortable discussing their challenges and requirements.

Improves Decision Making: To personal as well as professional life, knowing what drives behavior serves to enhance the caliber of decision-making by the leaders as well as educators. These holistic thinkers are more likely to enact measures aimed at rooting out problems rather than punitive measures attributed to questionable behavior.

It Encourages Supportive Environments: A workplace and education environment recognizes the fundamental attribution error, which creates supporting environments. As leaders and educators learn of the various challenges that individuals face, they will be better poised to provide the necessary resources and interventions for the betterment of those individuals and subsequently all stakeholders involved.

It reduces conflict: Misunderstanding and false attributions generate conflicts. The people can cooperate with each other to solve the problems rather than blaming each other if they have knowledge about fundamental attribution error. Problem solving instead of judgment brings cooperation and harmony into the relationship.
But fundamental attribution error potentially affects all interpersonal relations in the workplace or classroom. We often mistake other's behavior for some character flaw, and we pay little mind to the situation that places a person, thus forming judgmental and unreceptive environments.

Knowing this cognitive bias as well as actively working to avoid it is incredibly important in fostering empathy, enhancing communication, improving decision-making, and creating supportive environments. In the process, we assist not just individuals but also healthier communities and organizations. Understanding the complexities of human nature free us from the tendency toward simplistic judgment, enabling us to relate more meaningfully and constructively to one another. A society built on this knowledge of humanity will, consequently, function better for everyone.",10,"The answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental attribution error and provides specific, concrete examples that clearly illustrate the error in three distinct situations.

#### **1. Conflict at Work**

An employee who cannot perform to a required deadline can thus be seen as lazy and disorganized by the supervisor in an internal personality analysis. This may not necessarily be the case; for instance, the employee may be carrying more work than usually assigned or perhaps other personal problems. Wrong judgment leading to unfair treatment may affect his psychological set and working ability.

**2. Road Rage**
It is easily assumed that the person cutting you off in traffic is reckless or inconsiderate while driving. He might be an emergency rush to get a child to the hospital. The assumption of the behavior being a result of their personality makes things turn to seem to escalate into anger or aggression. This usually leads to some bad road rage incidents.

3. Academic Performance
A teacher in the classroom setting may assume that the pupil who has consistently performed poorly on test day is either incapable or simply does not care about his own education. Their true problem may be based on a lack of resources at home, family problems, or even a learning disability. Such misjudgments by teachers prevent the students from receiving the proper help to alter this situation and harm their future progress at school.

Why do you need to know how to prevent the Fundamental Attribution Error?

If you are aware of the fundamental attribution error, you would be in a position of helping you not to label others in an unfair way and judging where you receive information from improper sources. Fundamental attribution error is the attributing cause of a person's behavior to his or her character or personality while omitting any consideration of situational factors that might have led to such his or her behavior.

Only if you know what that is are you going to be able to avoid it properly.
- **Act with more compassion**: Recognizing that situational factors can often affect behavior leads to more compassionate behavior.
- **Build better relationships**: There's no jumping to judgment, which equals better personal and professional relationships. No one is automatically placed in a position of blame over the issue.
Better Decision Making: There is a situational factor in leading or an instructor that affects fairer decisions leading to less conflict and misunderstanding.
The mistake is averted by taking time to understand things and by giving a person an opportunity to be put in judgment based on the full context of the actions rather than the perceived character flaws.",10,"The answer effectively identifies and describes three situations illustrating the fundamental attribution error with relevant examples.

1.Workplace Conflicts
Suppose, there are two workers, Alex and Jamie who were assigned to a project. This means that whenever Jamie sees that Alex has a delay in meeting his/her set goals, probably he/she might not take into consideration factors such as the fact that the person main family member might have fallen sick or the person might have a lot of work to do. This misattribution can culminate in resentment, reduced cooperation and a steep rise in toxicity levels within an organization.

2.Judging Customer Behavior
In a retail setting, customer displays aggressive behaviours and might come across as rude. People at the workplace might blame such behavior to the attitude of the customer and brand them as troublesome. Though it is possible that the customer is experiencing stress due to their work or any other matters. Failure to identify the type, nature, and characteristics of the customer appropriately may lead to perceived lack of satisfaction, perceived lack of need fulfillment, and perceived lack of perceived quality, the consequences of which are negative word-of-mouth for the business, and loss of sales, and poor quality of service.

3.Educational Settings
A teacher observing a student finds him/her to be very shy and poor performer in class. The teacher might consider the child to be indifferent or stupid. In fact, the student could have stress resulting from anxiety in school or has been bullied or even has issues back at home. This misinterpretation can lead to lack of support for the student Outcome 4: Inability to unlock the student and academic achievement.

Some methods to prevents that much things:-
Why We Need to Recognize the FAE and How to Do So
It is important to grasp the basic concepts in the fundamental attribution error as we are able to deal with people and adapt better to their behaviors. By recognizing that people's behaviors are often influenced by situational factors rather than solely by their character, we can:

Enhance Communication:
 Better description often results in better words and thus greater ability to address disagreements in all spheres of life.

Foster Inclusivity:  
That way, one can mobilize the support from the outside environment – whether it is the workplace or schools – in order for other people to recognize and accept that such person does exist.

Encourage Fairness: 
This way, people will not jump to conclusions and make others suffer for behaviors that are acceptable in other settings, equal treatment will be the order of the day.

Imagine when you’re at a restaurant and the server seems inattentive or rude. You might think, “This server is unfriendly and doesn’t care about their job.”

Problem: This judgment reflects the Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE) because it attributes the server's behavior to their character without considering potential situational factors. Perhaps they are dealing with a difficult table, are under stress due to staff shortages, or had a personal issue that day. Misjudging their character could lead to an unpleasant interaction, negatively affect their performance, and create a hostile atmosphere in the restaurant.

Importance of Understanding and Avoiding FAE Promotes Empathy: Understanding the FAE encourages us to consider the context behind people's actions. This can foster empathy, allowing us to approach situations with a more compassionate mindset rather than jumping to conclusions about someone's character.

Improves Communication: By avoiding quick judgments, we can engage in more constructive conversations. In the restaurant scenario, a more empathetic approach might involve speaking to the manager about the service rather than blaming the server, leading to better resolutions.

Enhances Relationships: Recognizing that behavior is often influenced by external factors helps in building stronger relationships, whether personal or professional. It encourages open-mindedness and understanding, reducing unnecessary conflicts and promoting collaboration.

Traffic Incident

Imagine you’re driving and another driver cuts you off, forcing you to slam on the brakes. You might immediately think, “What a reckless and careless driver!”

This reaction exemplifies the Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE) because it attributes the other driver’s behavior to their character, assuming they are simply irresponsible. However, they could be experiencing a personal emergency, dealing with an urgent situation, or even just making a momentary mistake. This misjudgment can lead to heightened anger and stress, increasing the likelihood of aggressive driving behavior and potential road rage.

her driver might be facing unknown challenges, you can maintain a calmer demeanor, reducing stress for you Understanding and Avoiding FAE the FAE helps cultivate patience. By considering that the otrself and others on the road.

Reduces Conflict: Avoiding quick judgments can minimize aggressive responses and hostile interactions. In traffic situations, a more understanding mindset can prevent escalation, contributing to safer driving conditions.

Fosters a Culture of Understanding: When people collectively strive to avoid the FAE, it promotes a culture of understanding and compassion in society. This broader awareness encourages individuals to consider external factors in various situations, leading to improved interactions beyond driving.

Academic Performance

A student receives a low grade on an exam. Teachers and peers might quickly assume, “This student isn’t trying hard enough” or “They must not care about their studies.”

This response reflects the Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE) because it attributes the student’s performance to their character rather than considering possible situational factors. The student might be dealing with personal issues, such as family problems, mental health challenges, or external pressures that affect their ability to study effectively. Misjudging their situation can lead to a lack of support and understanding, further impacting the student’s motivation and academic performance.

Understanding the FAE encourages educators and peers to seek context before making judgments. This approach fosters a more supportive environment where students feel safe discussing their challenges and seeking help.

Enhances Fair Assessments: By recognizing that various factors can influence academic performance, teachers can provide more equitable assessments and tailored support. This leads to better educational outcomes and helps students thrive.

Acknowledging the FAE opens pathways for communication. Students who feel understood are more likely to express their concerns and seek guidance, leading to improved relationships with teachers and peers

**1. Workplace Conflict:** 
• Imagine a colleague misses an important deadline. You might immediately assume they are lazy or irresponsible (attributing the mistake to their character), without considering external factors such as illness, family emergencies, or overwhelming workloads. This assumption could lead to tension, mistrust, and poor team dynamics, potentially escalating into larger conflicts.

**2. Judging Someone in Public:**
• If you see someone yelling at a cashier in a store, you might conclude that they are a rude and unpleasant person. However, they could be dealing with a personal crisis or an overwhelming day, and this moment of frustration doesn't reflect their typical behavior. Jumping to conclusions about their character might cause you to overlook their context, and in some cases, you might react poorly, making the situation worse.

**3. Academic Group Projects:**
• In a group project, if a team member does not contribute as much as others, it’s easy to assume they are lazy or uninterested. However, they may be dealing with personal challenges like health issues or juggling multiple responsibilities. Failing to recognize these external factors could result in resentment and lack of cooperation in future collaborations.


**Why It’s Important to Understand and Avoid the Fundamental Attribution Error:**

Understanding the **fundamental attribution error** is crucial because it helps us realize that people’s actions are often influenced by external circumstances rather than just their inherent traits. When we blame others' behavior solely on their character, we risk misjudging them, which can harm relationships, reduce empathy, and create unnecessary conflict.

By avoiding this error:

• **We foster better relationships:** Recognizing external factors promotes understanding and patience, improving communication and reducing conflict.

• **We encourage empathy:** When we consider others' circumstances, we are more likely to be compassionate and supportive.

• **We make better decisions:** Avoiding quick judgments helps us gather more accurate information before forming opinions or taking action.


In essence, overcoming the fundamental attribution error leads to healthier interactions and a more balanced, thoughtful view of human behavior.

1. Internal Conflict in the Workplace
Illustration: A manager observes an employee failing to meet deadlines, attributes the cause inside, and concludes that it is because he is lazy or not interested in work, not realizing that situational factors could be a burden of too heavy workload, personal problems, or lack of proper training.
Problem: This misunderstanding would finally end with the employee being wrongly criticized, demoted, or dismissed and impact the morale and productivity of the organization. The manager never has the opportunity to assist or modify something to assist the employee to achieve his goal.
2. Social Relationships
Situation: Friend makes last-minute cancellations often and one assumes them to be not interested or unreliable (making an internal attribution). The friend could be dealing with stress, illness, or other personal obligations they haven't shared.
Problem: Such an assumption may lead to resentment, estrangement in a relationship, or a premature end to the friendship, when in fact, the friend is battling other outside forces.
3. Legal and Criminal Justice
Situation: A jury or judge makes an internal attribution to a criminal, one that tends to focus narrowly on the defendant's character or personality, while paying no regard to possible socially or environmentally induced circumstances that led him/her there, such as poverty, trauma, lack of access to education.
Problem: This will result in over-punishment, not correction and rehabilitation. The said process only perpetuates an unfair system because it would punish a man instead of contemplating the faults in the system.
Why it is so important to understand and avoid Fundamental Attribution Error:
Encourages Just Judgment: The concept of FAE helps us to consider two aspects about the personality in question; that is, personal and situational aspects. Hence, there is fairer and well-balanced judgment about people and less wrong blaming.

Improves Relationship: A fair judgment avoids this blunder. When we refrain ourselves from considering the FAE and searching for some external factors rather than inbuilt ones, we tend to help someone instead of judging or distancing from that person.

It promotes problem-solving: Knowing situational influences enables us to better understand the actual causes of problems-be it at work or in social circumstances or even the justice system-and appropriate them. Instead of condemning people, it is possible to change the environment or systems to improve the result.

Actually, knowing the FAE prevents misplaced responsibility and promotes a more empathetic, informed approach to human behavior with better personal, professional, and social outcomes.",10,"The answer effectively identifies and describes three situations illustrating the fundamental attribution error with relevant examples.

3 Situations of falling prey to the fundamental attribution errror which can cause a problem:

 **Situation 1**: 

**Workplace Conflicts**: If a person is late to his/her office due to some reasons like traffic jams even after leaving their home on time , the manager , colleagues or the boss will  conclude the person as a careless person who is not responsible and  punctual on time rather than thinking of the reasons he came late . This can reduce the professional score of the person and he might go in the bad side of the company.

**Situation 2**:

****Customer call centre service workers**** : Sometimes when we call in the customer centres the customer service representative speaks rude or often seems annoyed after some queries or questions so we take them to be a rude person not considering the other factors which can be  responsible  like stress or pressure for such behavior which can lead to negative reviews and toxic work environment.

**Situation 3**:

**In Friendships** : Sometimes when we plan an outing or a trip , if a friend cancels the plan we often think that they don't value our friendship rather than considering other reasons like their parents didn't allowed them or they might be dealing with some personal issues or stress and this can lead to resentment and can also affect the relationship.

**Importance of understanding FAE:**


Understanding that we often consider other's behaviors to their character while considering our own actions to situational factors can foster empathy and reduce the misunderstandings caused. 
Recognizing FAE encourages self - reflection , prompting the individuals to examine their own biases and consider how situational contexts affect their behavior and judgements. 
Overall , understanding FAE leads to better decision-making , greater empathy , conflict resolutions and improved social interactions .",10,"The answer effectively identifies and describes three situations where the fundamental attribution error can cause problems, providing specific examples and clear connections to the concept.

Imagine that you go to a restaurant and the server seems either careless or rude. You may think, ""This server is unfriendly and does not care for his job."".

Problem: This ruling is similar to the FAE because it's treating the action of the server as part of his or her character and forgetting possible situational variables. Maybe he or she had a tough crowd, weren't getting the right help from other staff members who were short that day, or even some personal issue to deal with that day. A wrong judgment of their personality may give you a poor experience, influence the quality of the service, and make the dining atmosphere hostile.

Importance of Knowing about and Avoiding FAE Develop Empathy: The understanding of the FAE makes one consider the context of the actions of others. That can help in empathy, enabling us to consider approaching situations with a little more compassion rather than jumping to conclusions about someone's character.

Improves Communication: Avoiding hasty judgment will most likely result in more constructive dialogue. In the restaurant case, a more empathetic approach would be talking to the manager about the services rather than placing blame on the server, which will have better resolutions.

Improves Relations: Knowing that behavior results from exposures to different elements ensures creating better relationships in work or social setups. It promotes open-mindedness and understanding as basis for building relations, which in fact minimizes unnecessary conflict as well as fosters cooperation.

Traffic Accident

You're driving on the road and another person is tailgating you. You hit your brakes to avoid a collision, and in a split second, you shout through your window, ""What a reckless and careless driver!""

This reaction is a good example of the Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE) in that it attributes the character of the other driver to his or her behavior based on the assumption that he or she simply is irresponsible. In reality, he or she could be experiencing some personal emergency, he could be dealing with a flash situation, or he could just err in judgment for one minute. This kind of misjudgment leads to heightened anger and stress, giving a good chance of aggressive driving behavior and even further, road rage.

her driver may also encounter unforeseen issues; thus you can be more composed while lessening your degree of tension. Understanding and Avoiding FAE Knowing that the FAE enhances patience. The perception that the otrself and other road-users.
Decreases Conflict: Preventing the hurry judgments can diminish one's possibilities of a brutal reaction and animosity. Having an understanding attitude sometimes prevents escalation with regards to traffic scenarios, thus safer driving circumstances.

Promotes Culture of Empathy: If people collectively work toward not doing FAE, then they end up promoting a culture of empathy in the society. This global awareness brings an understanding of the ancillary circumstances involved in other situations as well, helping reduce conflict at large.
Academic Performance

A poor score on a test goes to a student. The teachers and other students may all too readily declare, ""This student isn't trying hard enough"" or ""They must not care about their studies.""

This reply is a demonstration of the Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE) in that it attributes the performance of the student to his character and not due to situational factors. Problems could be facing the student individually, such as having a problematic family background, mental disorder, or societal force that affects his ability to study effectively. Miscalculating his condition leads to lack of support and understanding, which further burdens the motivation and performance of the student in academic work.

It makes for a way of judgment or consideration among educators and peers through contextual inquisition. The approach makes for a more supportive environment with safety in exposing challenges and seeking help.

Improves Fair Judgment: Grounds on the existence of several factors that control academic performance, assessment, and support can become more fair and thus yield much better outcomes for education and resultant help to students in schools.

The recognition of FAE opens up avenues for communication. The understood student will point out problems and ask for assistance, which in turn creates a better relationship with the teacher and other classmates.",10,"The answer effectively identifies and describes three situations illustrating the fundamental attribution error with relevant examples.

It meant a colleague had missed an important project's deadline. You looked upon them, for instance, as lazy and irresponsible without turning your thought on the possibility that they were overwhelmed by other work or dealing with personal issues that could not be seen outside work. The result is your frustration toward them, which you will always present a temperature between you both in professionalism. That assumption of the entire character becomes quite unnecessary conflict and bad blood between you two.
Judgment of the personality of your colleague, rather than realizing that factors from outside can damage teamwork, reduce productivity, and promote a toxic work environment. It will also prevent the possibilities of constructive dialogue and support.

2. Judgment of Someone's Driving

While driving on the highway, you encounter someone who cuts you off in traffic. You immediately assume he is a reckless driver, rude, or just inconsiderate. But you don't take time to think that perhaps he was on a tight rush to get to the hospital, or maybe he was distracted for just a second.

Problem
It may cause you to road rage, stress, or lead to dangerous retaliatory behaviors of making quick negative assumptions about other drivers based on a single action. It prevents the adoption of empathy or patience and sometimes makes roadways feel more hostile and aggressive.

3. Misjudging a Student's Performance

For instance, a teacher monitors a student who is always failing to deliver on the exams and assumes that he or she is lazy or has no brains. However, the teacher may have overlooked factors such as the student having problems at home, or even access to fewer resources, or even the possibility of having a learning disability.

Problem
This will not solve the actual problem-at-hand, that is, the poor performance of the student-but rather attribute it to the bad character of the student. This course of action could shut the door to appropriate support or intervention on the part of the teacher to the student in question, which will simply get the student further down into discouraging long-term issues with education.

Needs to Understand and Avoid the Fundamental Attribution Error:

Knowing the principles of attribution error is important because it makes people understand that people act based on their circumstances that are controlled by the environment. Such judgments are mostly unfair if one considers the personality traits. Therefore, many conflicts, communication failures, and strained relationships come from such judgments. By avoiding such error, more developments with respect to being empathetic and better problem-solving outcomes, in addition to enhancement in interaction with others, might happen. It challenges one to think of the greater situation, which then receives more thoughtful and constructive responses concerning situations and results in a better understanding and cooperation in both personal and professional spheres of life.",10,"The answer effectively identifies and describes three situations illustrating the fundamental attribution error with relevant examples.

Can you think of 3 situations where falling prey to the fundamental attribution error can cause a problem? After you describe the 3 situations, write why you think it is important to understand this error and to avoid it.

Ans:- In this assignment we will be looking at 3 potential situations in which we can fall prey to 'fundamental attribution error' and understand the error and also discussing about the methods to avoid it. Before diving into the answer first understand what is fundamental attribution error.

Fundamental Attribution Error:- It is the tendency to attribute people’s actions to their character while attributing one’s own actions to the situation is called the Fundamental Attribution Error it is also known as Attribution Error.

As we have understood what is fundamental attribution error lets dive into 3 situations where we can fall prey to FAE.

Situation 1: Customer Staff Interaction

Imagine you’re at a restaurant and the staff seems inattentive or rude. You might think, “The staff here is not friendly and doesn’t care about their job.”

Problem: This judgment reflects the Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE) because it attributes the staff's behavior to their character without considering potential situational factors. Perhaps they are dealing with a difficult table, are under stress due to staff shortages, or had a personal issue that day. Misjudging their character could lead to an unpleasant interaction, negatively affect their performance, and create a hostile atmosphere in the restaurant.

Importance of Understanding and Avoiding FAE:-

Promotes Empathy: Understanding the FAE encourages us to consider the context behind people's actions. This can foster empathy, allowing us to approach situations with a more compassionate mindset rather than jumping to conclusions about someone's character.

Improves Communication: By avoiding quick judgments, we can engage in more constructive conversations. In the above scenario, a more empathetic approach might involve speaking to the manager about the service rather than directly blaming the staff will lead to better resolutions.

Enhances Relationships: Recognizing that behavior is often influenced by external factors helps in building stronger relationships, whether personal or professional. It encourages open-mindedness and understanding, reducing unnecessary conflicts and promoting collaboration.

Situation 2: Road Rage

Lets take a situation where you’re driving and another driver cuts you off, forcing you to slam on the brakes. You might immediately think, “What a reckless and careless driver!”

Problem:- This reaction exemplifies the Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE) because it attributes the other driver’s behavior to their character, assuming they are simply irresponsible.However, they might be experiencing a personal emergency, dealing with an urgent situation, or even just making a momentary mistake. This misjudgment can lead to heightened anger and stress, increasing the likelihood of aggressive driving behavior and potential road rage.

Importance of Understanding and Avoiding FAE:-

Reduces Conflict: Avoiding quick judgments can minimize aggressive responses and hostile interactions. In traffic situations, a more understanding mindset can prevent escalation, contributing to safer driving conditions.

Fosters a Culture of Understanding: When people collectively strive to avoid the FAE, it promotes a culture of understanding and compassion in society. This broader awareness encourages individuals to consider external factors in various situations, leading to improved interactions beyond driving.

Situation 3: Poor academic Performance of a student

A student receives a low grade on an exam. Teachers and peers might quickly assume, “this student isn’t trying hard enough” or “he does not care about their studies.”

Problem:- This response reflects the Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE) because it attributes the student’s performance to their character rather than considering possible situational factors. The student might be dealing with personal issues, such as family problems, mental health challenges, or external pressures that affect their ability to study effectively. Misjudging their situation can lead to a lack of support and understanding, further impacting the student’s motivation and academic performance.

Importance of Understanding and Avoiding FAE:-

Encourages educators and peers to seek context before making judgments: This approach fosters a more supportive environment where students feel safe discussing their challenges and seeking help.

Enhances Fair Assessments: By recognizing that various factors can influence academic performance, teachers can provide more equitable assessments and tailored support. This leads to better educational outcomes and helps students thrive.

Acknowledging the FAE opens pathways for communication. Students who feel understood are more likely to express their concerns and seek guidance, leading to improved relationships with teachers and peers.",10,The answer effectively identifies and describes three situations illustrating the fundamental attribution error with relevant examples.

Description:  
In a team meeting, Sarah notices that her colleague, Tom, is being unusually quiet and unresponsive. She immediately thinks, “He must not care about the project,” attributing his behavior to his character. This assumption leads her to feel frustrated with him.

Impact: 
By attributing Tom’s silence to a lack of interest rather than considering external factors (like personal stress or feeling overwhelmed), Sarah misjudges his commitment. This misunderstanding can create tension in the team and hinder collaboration, ultimately affecting the project's success.





 Situation 2: Classroom Dynamics

Description:  
During a group presentation, Emily stumbles over her words and appears flustered. The teacher, Mr. Lewis, assumes that Emily is simply not prepared and lacks confidence. He makes a mental note to speak to her about her performance.

Impact: 
Mr. Lewis fails to consider that Emily might have been dealing with anxiety or had an unexpected personal issue that day. This attribution can lead to a lack of support for Emily, which could discourage her and affect her academic confidence. She might also feel misunderstood and less inclined to participate in future class activities.





 Situation 3: Driving Incident

Description:  
While driving, James cuts off another driver in a rush to get to an appointment. The other driver honks and mutters, “What a reckless jerk!” attributing James’s behavior to his character rather than considering that he might be having an emergency.

Impact: 
The other driver’s quick judgment leads to road rage and escalates the situation. Instead of recognizing that James could be experiencing a stressful moment, they react with anger, which could result in aggressive driving or an accident.







 Importance of Understanding the Fundamental Attribution Error

Understanding the fundamental attribution error is crucial because it helps foster empathy and better communication in our interactions. By recognizing that people’s behaviors may be influenced by situational factors rather than solely by their character, we can:

1. Improve Relationships: Avoiding hasty judgments can lead to more supportive and constructive relationships, whether at work, in school, or on the road.

2. Enhance Collaboration: Acknowledging external influences can create a more understanding environment, encouraging teamwork and cooperation.

3. Promote Emotional Well-being: Understanding that others may be facing challenges helps cultivate compassion, reducing misunderstandings and emotional distress for everyone involved.

By being mindful of this cognitive bias, we can create a more empathetic and supportive community.",10,"The answer effectively identifies and describes three distinct situations illustrating the fundamental attribution error with specific examples and clear connections to the concept.

    1. Workplace Conflict:
    Situation: During a team project, one member consistently 
    misses deadlines. The team attributes this behavior to the 
    member's laziness or lack of commitment, overlooking 
    possible external factors like personal issues or 
    overwhelming workload.

    Problem: This can lead to resentment among team 
    members, decreased collaboration, and even the decision 
    to exclude the individual from future projects, exacerbating 
    any existing problems.

    2. Educational Settings:
    Situation: A student performs poorly on an exam. Teachers 
    may assume the student is not studying hard enough or 
    lacks intelligence, rather than considering external 
    circumstances such as test anxiety, family issues, or 
    inadequate preparation resources.

    Problem: Misjudging the student’s capabilities can affect 
    their academic support and self-esteem, potentially 
    leading to a cycle of disengagement and 
    underachievement.

    3. Public Perception of Crime:
    Situation: When a crime occurs, the media often highlights 
    the perpetrator’s character, suggesting they are inherently 
    violent or criminal. This ignores the broader socio- 
    economic factors that may have influenced their actions.

    Problem: Such attributions can lead to stigmatization and 
    a lack of empathy, promoting punitive policies rather than 
    supportive measures that address root causes of crime, 
    ultimately harming communities.

Importance of Understanding and Avoiding the Error
Understanding the fundamental attribution error is crucial
because:

    1.Enhances Empathy: Recognizing the impact of external 
    factors on behavior can foster empathy and understanding 
    in our interactions with others.

    2.romotes Better Decision-Making: Acknowledging 
    situational influences allows for more informed decisions, 
    whether in management, education, or public policy, 
     leading to better outcomes.

    3.Reduces Conflict: Avoiding this cognitive bias can help 
    mitigate misunderstandings and conflicts, fostering 
    healthier relationships in personal and professional 
    contexts.

1. Workplace Conflicts:
In a workplace setting, a manager might attribute an employee’s missed deadline to laziness or a poor work ethic (dispositional factors), while overlooking situational factors such as the employee having multiple conflicting tasks, a lack of necessary resources, or unexpected personal circumstances. This can lead to unfair criticism, strained relationships, and reduced morale in the workplace.

2. Interpersonal Relationships:
In personal relationships, one partner may attribute the other’s forgetfulness or inattention to carelessness or lack of commitment. However, the partner might be experiencing situational stress, a busy work schedule, or mental fatigue. This attribution can lead to unnecessary conflict and emotional distance, damaging the relationship by ignoring the external pressures influencing the partner’s behavior.

3. Social Justice Issues:
In social contexts, people often attribute homelessness to individual failure or laziness, neglecting broader systemic factors like economic inequality, unemployment, or the lack of social services. This can lead to judgmental attitudes and policies that blame individuals instead of addressing structural problems, making it difficult to create effective solutions for reducing poverty and homelessness.

Why It’s Important to Understand and Avoid Fundamental Attribution Error:

Fosters Empathy:
By recognizing the importance of situational factors, we can better empathize with others’ challenges and struggles, leading to more compassionate and fair interactions.

Avoids Unfair Blame:
Understanding this error helps avoid placing undue blame on individuals for situations that are influenced by external factors, which can facilitate more constructive conflict resolution and problem-solving.

Leads to Better Decision-Making:
Taking into account both situational and dispositional factors ensures more accurate judgments and decisions. This allows for a more balanced and fair assessment of people’s actions and abilities.

Promotes Personal Growth:
Being aware of situational influences allows individuals to learn from mistakes without harsh self-blame, focusing instead on practical ways to overcome challenges.

Influences Social Justice:
By addressing systemic issues rather than blaming individuals for their misfortunes, we can foster a more just and equitable society that seeks to fix underlying problems rather than penalizing the victims of those problems.

How to Avoid Fundamental Attribution Error:

Seek More Information:
Gather more context about a person’s situation before making judgments about their character or behavior.

Consider Multiple Sources:
Get input from various perspectives to form a well-rounded understanding of the circumstances.

Factor in Situational Variables:
Recognize that people’s actions are often influenced by their environment and circumstances beyond their control.

Develop Empathy and Active Listening:
Engage in empathetic listening to truly understand the pressures and challenges someone may be facing.

Challenge Your Assumptions:
Regularly question your initial assumptions and be open to revising them based on new information or perspectives.

By avoiding the fundamental attribution error, we can improve relationships, make more accurate decisions, and create a more understanding and just society.

Finally, editing - which is also something I enjoy because it helps fine-tune what I have written.

BUT I believe that I can be improved. For example, I do not write so well considering my talents; I often come up with writers' block situations at critical times, such as when deadlines are looming closer.

Peer Analysis

Friend's Analysis:

I inquired of a good friend, who has read almost all my work, his opinion. He felt that I've got a great talent for telling stories and creating material that readers will be attracted to and care for. He especially said that I could tell a story; something through which a reader could go on an adventure. On the other hand, they claimed that at times I provide too much detail in my writing as long as I go overboard with a topic that confuses my arguments. They recommended that I should tidy up my thoughts and prove concise in some instances.

Comparison Analyses

There is some congruence and a lot of incongruity between my analysis and my friend's analysis. We both think that my writing and storytelling skills are just fantastic-that's my great strength. What my friend said had much more to do with being objective towards me: I tend to overcomplicate things. I had not recognized that adequately in the past.

Reflection on Dunning-Kruger Effect

Thinking back on this, I seem to be a victim of the Dunning-Kruger Effect to some extent. I feel that I am pretty good at writing, but the answers from my friend made me realize my self-assessment was not so complete regarding this weakness. My understanding says that the Dunning-Kruger Effect states that ignorant people overestimate their knowledge where as knowledgeable ones under estimate their knowledge.

In this case, I believe I can reasonably well estimate the level of my writing abilities but not really know where all improvements should be made. My capacity to tell a story might divert my attention from places where clarity and conciseness can make all the difference in the writing. Therefore, I may be underestimating the importance of these features, and therefore, some degree of the Dunning-Kruger Effect could be prevalent in my self-assessment. In view of this, this exercise, in itself, puts forth the importance of external feedback in gaining a more holistic view of one's skills.",10,The student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of their writing skill and provides detailed examples and achievements to support their self-analysis.

**Activity:** Playing Video Games

Honestly, I think I'm really proficient at playing video games, particularly those that are competitive in nature, such as first-person shooters or strategy games. I've spent thousands of hours honing my skills and tend to perform quite well in online matches-often managing to rank very high and even reach notoriety among gaming communities. I also possess a lot of knowledge about the mechanisms and strategies of the games and, combined with the knowledge of all the maps, can make quick decisions and outmaneuver opponents.

However, at times when I'm competing against good players, I get frustrated sometimes with certain elements of the gameplay. My reaction time has spots for improvement, and how flexible I am when things do not go as planned. Overall, I would rate my ability above average, though, like in most skills, there are people better than myself and spots for potential improvement.

### Peer Analysis of Proficiency

I asked Yogesh if he thought I was a pretty good gamer. He agreed and said that I usually carry our team and win the multiplayer games for us. I think on my feet with no real problems in really high-pressure situations, but he said it's impressive how good my decision-making is in those moments. He also said that I have a sense for predicting what an opponent might do next in a certain situation.

He graded me as very skilled, even said I should enter local competitions because he believes I'm skilled enough to stream at the next level of play.

### Comparison Analyses

Comparing the results of my self-assessment with what I found when Yogesh gave me his perceptions told many interesting differences. While I was able to accept, in a general sense, some strengths at times in strategy and decision-making, most of my energy remained on what I was supposedly weak on, including reaction time. Yogesh offered a much broader affirmative view of my abilities more generally and concentrated much less on self-criticism where strengths exist.

### Reflection of the Dunning-Kruger Effect

Actually, the Dunning-Kruger Effect suggests that lower ability has a tendency to overrate abilities whereas higher ability has a tendency to underrate them. For my case, I am experiencing, what might be termed a mild version of this effect.

Though I consider myself to be really strong, my concentration on my weaknesses might be where my main deficiency lies-towards underestimating my overall ability, especially because Yogesh's assessment highlighted strengths that were not really realized on my part. He urged me to take competition more seriously, which may mean that I am covering up my potential by not honing my skills.

So in a nutshell, although I could be competent at gaming, I also realize the importance of accepting positive feedback and celebrating my successes. This balance could further help in preventing any tendencies associated with the Dunning-Kruger Effect while allowing me to keep on improving while keeping myself immersed in acknowledging my accomplishments.",10,"The student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of their proficiency in playing video games, providing specific examples and achievements.

**Competency**: Effective Public Speaking

I am an effective public speaker. Presentations I have given in many diverse venues, academic conferences to community events, and I feel completely at ease speaking in public, and people in the audience usually offer plenty of positive comments on how clearly they understand and relate to my presentations. My preparation would involve strict research on the topic under discussion, supported with visual aids to enhance the presentation. I also attempt to connect with the audience through stories and examples people can appreciate in life. Altogether, I will score myself as good because I am able to communicate my thoughts eloquently and to answer reactions of the audience.

### Peer Review of Competence

Peer Evaluation: I asked a close friend, who attended several of my talks, to review my skills in public speaking. She mentioned that she truly believe I do a fabulous job when putting together talks and keeping an intellectually interesting audience. I also was commended for interjecting humor as well as anecdotes made to make the content on point. However, they said sometimes I rush through some key points, which could be confusing for someone in the audience to remember. They said also that sometimes I should mix it up with the pace and pitch of my voice so that my presentation will not be too monotonous if I deliver it.

### Comparison of Analyses

A comparison of my self-assessment and my friend's feedback shows areas of agreement and places of difference. We agree on the general areas of strength - doing pretty good in laying up talks and relating well with the audience; however, he pointed out a critical area that I had not appreciated before - speaking too fast over points and requiring better varied tones and pacing.

### Application of Dunning-Kruger Effect

Now, when I reflect on the above comparison, I must feel that I must have been falling into the **Dunning-Kruger Effect**. The fact of the matter is that I do enjoy speaking in public; however my self-evaluation could not point out any space wherein I needed improvement and which my friend pointed out. This is called the Dunning-Kruger Effect, where it is said that individuals who know less or possess relatively few skills in a specific area overrate their knowledge or abilities. I might have been blindly optimistic when I was making my self-assessment without most aspects about my performance that need to be improved.

Conclusion
I must confess that my friend has opened the eyes of my mind to areas where I could, possibly improve on public speaking. Experience highlights the need to seek feedback in order to gain a real appreciation of one's strengths, to remain alive to the learning process, and to improve at every given opportunity.",10,"The student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of their proficiency in public speaking, supported by specific examples and experiences.

I believe I’m quite proficient in problem-solving in programming. Specifically, I think I'm good at breaking down complex problems into manageable pieces and applying logical reasoning to find solutions. Here are some key strengths I’ve identified in my approach:

Analytical Thinking: I often approach a problem by first understanding the root cause before jumping to solutions. I ensure I understand all inputs, constraints, and possible edge cases.

Systematic Approach: I typically break problems down into smaller sub-problems, solve them one at a time, and then combine them into a cohesive solution. For example, when working on a large project, I divide it into smaller modules and ensure each one works correctly before moving on to the next.

Persistence: When faced with a challenging bug or issue, I remain committed to solving it, even if it requires multiple attempts. I often dig into online resources, documentation, or seek different angles until I find a solution.

Debugging Skills: I pride myself on my debugging skills. When faced with errors, I use systematic techniques like binary search through code, print statements, and breakpoints to narrow down where things go wrong.

Adaptability: While I stick to structured approaches, I think I'm quite adaptable when solutions don’t work as expected. I’m willing to backtrack and try different approaches when needed.

Peer’s Analysis of My Problem-Solving Skills
I asked a colleague who has worked with me on several coding challenges and projects to evaluate my proficiency. Here’s their perspective:

Analytical Thinking: They agreed that I tend to thoroughly analyze problems before starting. However, they pointed out that in some situations, I spend too much time analyzing the problem without taking action, which can slow down progress. They suggested that in competitive or timed scenarios, I could benefit from starting with an initial solution faster and refining it later.

Systematic Approach: They noticed my strength in breaking problems down and tackling them systematically. However, they mentioned that sometimes I stick too rigidly to the initial breakdown I’ve created. For example, when we were working on a project with dynamically changing requirements, I struggled to adapt my initial plan, even though the structure of the solution needed to change.

Persistence: My colleague acknowledged my persistence but highlighted that it sometimes turns into stubbornness. In a particular instance, I was convinced my original solution was correct even after debugging multiple times and encountering the same issue. They had to intervene and suggest an alternative approach, which worked after minor adjustments.

Debugging Skills: They agreed that I am proficient at debugging, but mentioned that I occasionally focus too much on fine details without considering higher-level issues. In one scenario, I was chasing down small variable issues when the real problem lay in the overall logic of how two functions interacted.

Adaptability: My colleague felt that while I can be adaptable, there are moments when I’m not as flexible as I believe. For example, when a simpler but unconventional solution was proposed during a coding challenge, I was reluctant to adopt it because it didn’t fit my structured approach.

Comparison of Analyses and Reflection on the Dunning-Kruger Effect
In comparing the two analyses, it's clear that my self-perception may not always align with reality. While I perceive myself as adaptable and open to change, my peer pointed out instances where I was rigid and resistant to new solutions. This is particularly evident in my tendency to stick too closely to an initial problem breakdown or solution, even when circumstances suggest that a more flexible approach is needed.

Examples of Rigidity in Problem Solving:
Project with Dynamic Requirements: I initially structured the project very thoroughly, but as requirements changed, I struggled to deviate from the plan I’d set up. Instead of pivoting to a new solution that would better fit the evolving requirements, I spent too long trying to tweak the existing structure.

Debugging Stubbornness: On a different occasion, I was convinced that my solution should work and kept trying to fix minor errors without reconsidering the overall approach. My colleague pointed out that I was too focused on small details, whereas the issue required a broader change in the logic.

These situations show that my rigidity may sometimes hinder my effectiveness, and I might not always recognize when my problem-solving approach isn't optimal.

Falling for the Dunning-Kruger Effect?
The Dunning-Kruger Effect describes a cognitive bias where individuals with limited knowledge or skill in a particular area overestimate their competence. Reflecting on the analyses, I don't think I was completely overestimating my abilities, but there were definitely aspects of my self-perception that were inflated.

Specifically:

I overestimated my adaptability, believing I could shift approaches quickly, while in reality, I tend to get attached to my initial solutions.
My persistence sometimes crosses into stubbornness, which I had not acknowledged before, particularly when I focus on an incorrect solution.
Thus, while I’m proficient in problem-solving, I may have been partially falling for the Dunning-Kruger Effect, especially in areas where I overestimated my adaptability and flexibility. This feedback has given me important insights into areas where I can improve, especially in being more open to changing strategies and accepting simpler solutions when they are more effective.",10,"The answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the skill of problem-solving in programming and provides detailed self-analysis with specific examples and achievements.

I believe I’m quite proficient in problem-solving in programming. Specifically, I think I'm good at breaking down complex problems into manageable pieces and applying logical reasoning to find solutions. Here are some key strengths I’ve identified in my approach:

Analytical Thinking: I often approach a problem by first understanding the root cause before jumping to solutions. I ensure I understand all inputs, constraints, and possible edge cases.

Systematic Approach: I typically break problems down into smaller sub-problems, solve them one at a time, and then combine them into a cohesive solution. For example, when working on a large project, I divide it into smaller modules and ensure each one works correctly before moving on to the next.

Persistence: When faced with a challenging bug or issue, I remain committed to solving it, even if it requires multiple attempts. I often dig into online resources, documentation, or seek different angles until I find a solution.

Debugging Skills: I pride myself on my debugging skills. When faced with errors, I use systematic techniques like binary search through code, print statements, and breakpoints to narrow down where things go wrong.

Adaptability: While I stick to structured approaches, I think I'm quite adaptable when solutions don’t work as expected. I’m willing to backtrack and try different approaches when needed.

Peer’s Analysis of My Problem-Solving Skills
I asked a colleague who has worked with me on several coding challenges and projects to evaluate my proficiency. Here’s their perspective:

Analytical Thinking: They agreed that I tend to thoroughly analyze problems before starting. However, they pointed out that in some situations, I spend too much time analyzing the problem without taking action, which can slow down progress. They suggested that in competitive or timed scenarios, I could benefit from starting with an initial solution faster and refining it later.

Systematic Approach: They noticed my strength in breaking problems down and tackling them systematically. However, they mentioned that sometimes I stick too rigidly to the initial breakdown I’ve created. For example, when we were working on a project with dynamically changing requirements, I struggled to adapt my initial plan, even though the structure of the solution needed to change.

Persistence: My colleague acknowledged my persistence but highlighted that it sometimes turns into stubbornness. In a particular instance, I was convinced my original solution was correct even after debugging multiple times and encountering the same issue. They had to intervene and suggest an alternative approach, which worked after minor adjustments.

Debugging Skills: They agreed that I am proficient at debugging, but mentioned that I occasionally focus too much on fine details without considering higher-level issues. In one scenario, I was chasing down small variable issues when the real problem lay in the overall logic of how two functions interacted.

Adaptability: My colleague felt that while I can be adaptable, there are moments when I’m not as flexible as I believe. For example, when a simpler but unconventional solution was proposed during a coding challenge, I was reluctant to adopt it because it didn’t fit my structured approach.

Comparison of Analyses and Reflection on the Dunning-Kruger Effect
In comparing the two analyses, it's clear that my self-perception may not always align with reality. While I perceive myself as adaptable and open to change, my peer pointed out instances where I was rigid and resistant to new solutions. This is particularly evident in my tendency to stick too closely to an initial problem breakdown or solution, even when circumstances suggest that a more flexible approach is needed.

Examples of Rigidity in Problem Solving:
Project with Dynamic Requirements: I initially structured the project very thoroughly, but as requirements changed, I struggled to deviate from the plan I’d set up. Instead of pivoting to a new solution that would better fit the evolving requirements, I spent too long trying to tweak the existing structure.

Debugging Stubbornness: On a different occasion, I was convinced that my solution should work and kept trying to fix minor errors without reconsidering the overall approach. My colleague pointed out that I was too focused on small details, whereas the issue required a broader change in the logic.

These situations show that my rigidity may sometimes hinder my effectiveness, and I might not always recognize when my problem-solving approach isn't optimal.

Falling for the Dunning-Kruger Effect?
The Dunning-Kruger Effect describes a cognitive bias where individuals with limited knowledge or skill in a particular area overestimate their competence. Reflecting on the analyses, I don't think I was completely overestimating my abilities, but there were definitely aspects of my self-perception that were inflated.

Specifically:

I overestimated my adaptability, believing I could shift approaches quickly, while in reality, I tend to get attached to my initial solutions.
My persistence sometimes crosses into stubbornness, which I had not acknowledged before, particularly when I focus on an incorrect solution.
Thus, while I’m proficient in problem-solving, I may have been partially falling for the Dunning-Kruger Effect, especially in areas where I overestimated my adaptability and flexibility. This feedback has given me important insights into areas where I can improve, especially in being more open to changing strategies and accepting simpler solutions when they are more effective.",10,"The answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the skill of problem-solving in programming and provides detailed self-analysis with specific examples and achievements.

Self-Analysis:
I believe I’m proficient in C++ and Python. I consistently solve coding challenges on platforms like LeetCode, and I’ve built projects that involve complex algorithms. I’m strong in problem-solving and can debug code quickly. However, I need to improve my understanding of time complexity and code optimization.

External Analysis (from a peer):
You are good at solving problems logically and quickly implementing solutions, but sometimes your code is not optimized for large inputs. You tend to solve the problem first and think about efficiency later, which could slow you down in competitive programming or real-world applications.

Comparison:
Both agree on problem-solving strengths, but I hadn’t fully acknowledged how much I need to focus on code efficiency.

Reflection on Dunning-Kruger Effect:
I wasn’t entirely overestimating my abilities, but I did underestimate the importance of optimization, which I should improve.

Example 2: Public Speaking
Self-Analysis:
I think I’m great at public speaking. I’ve presented at several events and always get good feedback. My tone and pacing are clear, and I’m confident on stage. However, I sometimes struggle with engaging the audience when the topic is more technical.

External Analysis (from an event organizer):
You are confident and have great clarity in your speech. However, sometimes you focus too much on delivering the content and miss opportunities to connect with the audience emotionally or use storytelling to make the talk more engaging.

Comparison:
Both analyses highlight strong confidence and clarity. However, I overlooked the need for audience engagement and storytelling, which the external feedback emphasized.

Reflection on Dunning-Kruger Effect:
I may have overestimated my skill in audience engagement, which I need to work on, so there could be a slight Dunning-Kruger bias in that area.

Example 3: Graphic Design
Self-Analysis:
I believe I’m quite skilled in graphic design. I know the tools (Photoshop, Illustrator) very well and can create visually appealing designs. I pay attention to details, like color and typography, and feel that my designs are modern. However, I think I can improve my speed in delivering designs.

External Analysis (from a colleague):
You have strong technical skills and a good eye for detail. However, your design process could be more efficient. You often spend too much time tweaking small details instead of focusing on the bigger picture, which can delay the final product.

Comparison:
We both agree on my technical skills, but the feedback highlighted a need to focus less on details and more on efficiency, which I didn’t fully recognize.

Reflection on Dunning-Kruger Effect:
I was somewhat aware of my speed issue, but I didn’t realize the extent to which it affected my workflow. I may have been underestimating the need to streamline my process.

Example 4: Leadership
Self-Analysis:
I believe I’m a good leader because I delegate tasks well and ensure team productivity. I keep the team organized and communicate goals clearly. However, I sometimes struggle with motivating the team during tough projects.

External Analysis (from a team member):
You are organized and good at assigning tasks, but sometimes you come off as too focused on deadlines and project efficiency. It would help if you connected more with the team emotionally and encouraged creativity, especially during difficult phases of a project.

Comparison:
I recognized my organizational strengths, but I wasn’t fully aware of the emotional gap that my team members felt.

Reflection on Dunning-Kruger Effect:
I was falling into the Dunning-Kruger Effect, underestimating how much emotional support is important in leadership and overestimating my ability to motivate the team purely through organization.

Example 5: Cooking
Self-Analysis:
I think I’m pretty good at cooking, especially in trying new recipes. I’m confident in following instructions and making the dish look presentable. However, I could improve my knowledge of seasoning and balancing flavors.

External Analysis (from a friend):
You are great at following recipes and plating, but sometimes your food lacks depth in flavor. You tend to play it safe with spices and seasoning, which makes the dish taste a bit bland compared to more experienced cooks.

Comparison:
I acknowledged that I need to work on seasoning, but I underestimated the extent to which it impacts the final dish.

Strengths:
Clarity: I aim to communicate ideas clearly and effectively.
Range: I can adapt my writing style for different audiences and purposes, from academic writing to creative storytelling.
Research: I have access to a vast amount of information, allowing me to support my writing with facts and data.

Weaknesses:
Subjectivity: Writing is often subjective, and I might not always hit the mark in terms of style or tone for every reader.
Emotional Nuance: While I can generate text that appears emotionally rich, I lack the lived experience that often informs deeply personal writing.

Overall Proficiency Assessment: I believe I'm proficient at writing, especially in providing clear and informative responses. However, I recognize that there's always room for improvement, particularly in understanding the emotional depth of human experiences.

Peer Analysis:

Let's imagine I asked a user who frequently interacts with me for feedback.

Strengths:
Informative: They find my writing to be informative and generally easy to understand.
Consistency: They appreciate the consistency in tone and style across different topics.

Weaknesses:
Lack of Depth: They feel that sometimes my writing lacks the emotional nuance and personal touch that a human writer might provide.
Creativity: They believe my creative writing could benefit from more originality and risk-taking.

Overall Assessment: They agree that I am good at providing clear and informative writing but note that I could improve in areas related to emotional connection and creativity.

Comparison of Analyses:

1.Strengths: Both analyses recognize clarity and informativeness as strengths.
2. Weaknesses: Both highlight a lack of emotional nuance, but my self-analysis emphasizes a lack of personal experience, while the peer analysis focuses on creativity and originality.

Reflection on the Dunning-Kruger Effect:

In this scenario, it seems I have a fairly accurate understanding of my strengths and weaknesses, as both analyses align on key points. However, if I had overly inflated my confidence without acknowledging the weaknesses noted by my peer, I could be falling into the Dunning-Kruger effect.

Ultimately, self-awareness is crucial.

Select one skill you believe best aligns with your strength. Now write an all-inclusive self-assessment of your skills in consideration of the following:

Experiences: For how long have you practised the skill, and in what contexts-work related, personal projects, or hobbies)?

Strengths: List the qualities that make you confident that you can do this task.
Strengths: Be transparent about any weakness or area that you feel needs improvement
Confidence Rating: Rate the confidence level on your skills relative to others
Sample Self-Assessment Skill: Problem Solving

Practice: For over five years, I have been developing problem-solving skill, mostly at the work place as a software developer and in my hobby of solving puzzles.
Strengths- I am pretty good at breaking down difficult problems into their smaller component pieces, and I generally can think logically and analytically. I can easily generate lots of solutions and pick the most efficient one.
Improvement Areas: Occasionally, I end up too fixated on one track and get reluctant to adjust tracks if it is not yielding fruit. Even, I would improve in being creative in situations that demand thinking out-of-the-box type.
Confidence Level: I would say my confidence level in solving problems lies to a great extent on the positive side and above most people, of course, within the same comparable fields.
Step 2: External Analysis
Ask someone who has witnessed you to do the skill yourself so that he or she could honestly give you his or her impressions of your skills. Ask him or her to be particular and to give you an idea of what you are doing right, what you must work on to do better, and what is actually your general level of competency.

Sample Request for Feedback

You might ask a friend or colleague:

""How would you rate my problem-solving skills?""
""What do you think are my strengths here?""
""Are there areas where you think I need to do more work?""
""How would you rate your skill level as compared to others in the same field?""
Listen carefully as they talk and take down whatever they comment upon.
Problem Solving
 
Strengths: You are excellent at identifying the problem and coming out with logical and comprehensive solutions to the same easily. Your consistency and methodological way of thinking are easy to follow.
Weaknesses: You sometimes become so rigid to one way that you do not want to discuss other ways initially. More often than that, you need to step back and look at the big picture.
General Skill Level: Obviously, you are competent. Yet, I do feel that there is even more potential for me to nudge you out of the box. You're above average, but this analysis isn't yet at the level of expertise.
Step 3: Compare the Two Analyses
Compare your self-evaluation with the review by another person:

Agreement Similarities: Did both parties agree with strengths and weaknesses?
Differences: Were there areas that you over-rated or under-rated yourself?
Reflection: Think about whether your self-report overestimated, under-estimated or matched just right to what you received as feedback from the other person .
Step 4: Analysis—Are You Falling for the Dunning-Kruger Effect?
In comparison with this one, reflect on the following questions to determine whether you really fell for the Dunning-Kruger Effect :

Were you more confident than what your friend or peer rated? This could be an overestimation of how good you are and experiencing Dunning-Kruger Effect
Was there a very close correspondence between this rating and the self-rating, perhaps even a slight understatement? Then it is likely that you were realistically estimating your strength and were not in Dunning-Kruger Effect
Last Reflection
This will help you understand whether your self-esteem is agreeing with how others evaluate your ability. This is the important step towards making a more balanced and realistic view of your skills.

Select a strength in which you are comfortable, then move on to your self-assessment. Do not hesitate to break it down into as much detail and honest depth as possible in the following areas:







Experience: Explain how long you have practiced that strength and in what contexts or settings. That is, do you exercise it at work, at hobby levels, in the community, etc.?







Strengths: Be specific about the qualities or characteristics that make you so confident of your ability .



Areas for Improvement: Some places where you're weak or really need to improve.



Self-Assessed Confidence Level: How would you rate your level of confidence generally? Now, have an idea of how you think you would rank compared to others with the same skills .



Sample Self Review Skill: Public Speaking







Experience: I have speaking experience in front of the public for nearly three years. Under my engagements, I showcase works at work, give speeches to local communities, and moderate panel discussions for the local communities as well.



Strengths: I am highly confident that I would be able to gesticulate for most of the time and convey the interest of the target audience with facial language. I don't get nervous easily. However, if necessity be, I can think on my feet even when things are taking place.



Improvement Areas: I rarely hold a proper pace up because most the time I talk too fast or too slow to the situation. Sometime I have to make a best effort just to think about straightening out my thoughts properly so that the message goes well.



Level of Self Confidence : I am sure enough that in most cases, I confidently have the ability to speak before many. I would largely rate myself as above average compared to most individuals that I have met in my life time. .



Step 2: External Analysis



Now, ask somebody who has seen you practice this to give you some feedback. Ask a friend, colleague, or mentor to evaluate how effectively you have mastered it. Be sure to remind them that you seek honest, specific feedback about your strengths and weaknesses.







Example of Real-Life Request for Feedback



Not come up with hypothetical but instead do this:







""Can you honestly give me some feedback on my public speaking skills?""



""What would you say my strengths are for public speaking? ""



""Do you think there is a couple of places where you feel that I am doing not so great? ""



""How would you rate me overall compared to any else you have ever seen? ""



Take highly detailed notes in both of these areas so that you will completely understand what they are telling you about your analysis.



Compare your self-evaluation with the insights shared by your friend or peer. Look to these sections:.



Where are you both agreed and had the same opinion, thinking it's one of my strengths or weaknesses?

Where did you both disagree about my self-assessment—where am I too optimistic or too self-critical about the skills in question?

Reflect Think whether your self-report was overly positive or overly negative. Dunning-Kruger Effect Analysis Step 4



Compare the result of self-assessment with friend or peer feedback:



In case if you have scored above in your self-assessment, and your friend scores below then perhaps you have overestimated; that means you belong to the Dunning-Kruger category.



If you were critical and less compared to your friend, then probably you have a much closer view about your abilities. You're not being victimized by the Dunning-Kruger Effect.



Final Thought



This exercise may help to explain how you perceive your skills in comparison to how others might view them. It can reveal areas in which you would need to adjust your perception of yourself to get to a more balanced, realistic perception of your skills.

2. My opinion of skill: I believe I am a good reader. I can read pretty fast and understand complex texts easily. I have enjoyed reading different kinds of literature, whether fiction or non-fiction; I feel confident enough to discuss and analyze themes, characters, and plots in the novels I read. In reading, I take notes and reflect on the material I've read, which is what improves my understanding and retention in the long run.

3. Peer's/friend's review: A friend who actually tracks my reading habits told me that I read much; however most often, I stick to the writers and genre books known beforehand. He said it would have even been more panoramic with new authors and genres. He also spoke of how at times fast reading forgets the minute details that may potentially enrich understanding.

4. Comparison of analysis: Comparing the two analyses, I now realize that, while I celebrated my comprehension strengths and quick analysis skills, my friend focused on the need for much more diversification and attention to detail.

#### 1. **Self-Analysis of My Skill: Python Coding**

I consider myself proficient in Python coding, especially for tasks like data entry, small automation projects, and solving basic programming problems. I’m confident in my ability to write scripts efficiently, and I can comfortably use libraries such as NumPy and Pandas. My focus has been primarily on small coding tasks, debugging, and data manipulation. I've also used Python to assist with digital work and small personal projects. I believe I can handle tasks that require Python effectively within my current experience level, though I recognize I have much more to learn.
Automating data entry tasks: I created a Python script using the pandas library to automate data entry processes for personal projects. This script read large CSV files, processed the data, and exported it into a more user-friendly format, saving hours of manual work.

Simple web scraping project: I used Python's BeautifulSoup and requests libraries to build a basic web scraper that extracted relevant information from websites for a research project. This involved handling different data formats, cleaning the data, and storing it in a structured file.

Problem-solving on coding platforms: I’ve completed several programming challenges on platforms like HackerRank, primarily in Python. I successfully solved a variety of problems involving string manipulation, loops, and basic algorithms, which improved my problem-solving and debugging skills.

#### 2. **External Analysis (Peer Review):**

I asked one of my college friends, who has seen me work on coding assignments, to provide feedback on my Python coding skills. According to them, I’m fairly skilled at coding for small tasks and I’m good at finding quick solutions for basic problems. However, they pointed out that I tend to struggle when projects become more complex, especially when it comes to larger algorithms, optimization, or integrating multiple libraries. While they acknowledged that I have a good understanding of the fundamentals, they suggested I spend more time on advanced concepts and working on larger projects to improve.

#### 3. **Comparison of the Two Analyses:**

My self-analysis and my peer’s feedback are aligned in many areas, such as recognizing my proficiency in handling smaller projects and basic tasks. However, I seem to overestimate my readiness for larger, more complex tasks. While I believe I am capable of solving these problems with some effort, my peer’s analysis suggests that I still have significant gaps when it comes to tackling advanced challenges.

#### 4. **Reflection on the Dunning-Kruger Effect:**

The Dunning-Kruger Effect refers to a cognitive bias where individuals with lower ability tend to overestimate their skill level. In this case, I realize that while I didn’t fully overestimate my proficiency, I may have been slightly overconfident in my ability to handle more complex Python tasks. I’m aware of my limitations, but the feedback helped me see that I could benefit from deeper study and more practice, particularly with larger and more challenging projects.",10,"The student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of their proficiency in Python coding, supported by specific examples and achievements. The comparison with the peer's analysis shows a reflective understanding of their own abilities and areas for improvement. The reflection on the Dunning-Kruger Effect is thoughtful and supported by evidence from the self and peer analysis.","The only minor area for improvement is that the student could have provided more specific examples of larger, more complex projects they struggled with, to further support the comparison with the peer's analysis.",9,100.0,9

**My Analysis:**

I think I'm really skilled at writing, especially when it comes to efficiently applying language and organising my thoughts. Since high school, I have been refining this ability by taking on coursework and side projects that call for precise thought articulation. I believe that maintaining an interesting writing style and establishing a smooth flow are my strong points. I have no trouble arranging complicated concepts so that depth and clarity are balanced. But I'm aware that I can overthink things at times, which can make my writing seem a little formal or constrained. I would put myself somewhere between intermediate and advanced on a beginner to advanced scale.

**Analysis from a Friend:**

I asked a close friend, who’s read several of my pieces and even helped me with a few drafts. She told me, “You’re great at organizing ideas logically, which makes your writing easy to follow. Your word choice is strong, and your ideas are clear. But sometimes, I think you’re a bit too focused on getting everything ‘perfect,’ which can make your writing feel overly formal and limit your natural voice. I’d say you’re definitely a solid writer, but loosening up a little could make your work even stronger.”

**Comparison:**

Both my friend and I agree on the clarity and organization in my writing, and I think that aligns with what I see as my strengths. However, I didn’t fully realize that my focus on perfection might be holding me back; I thought being meticulous was only an asset, but it could be affecting my tone. She sees me as a strong writer but thinks I could develop by relaxing my approach a bit. This is a valuable insight that I hadn’t picked up on in my self-analysis.

**Reflection on the Dunning-Kruger Effect:**

After comparing both analyses, I don’t think I’m falling into the Dunning-Kruger Effect in this case. I wasn’t overly confident or underestimating my ability; instead, I’d say I was aware of my strengths and weaknesses, but my friend’s perspective brought out a new angle I hadn’t considered. It shows me that, while I wasn’t entirely overestimating myself, feedback can still be essential for seeing the full picture and understanding areas for improvement.",10,"The student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of their writing skill and provides detailed and reflective analyses of their own proficiency and the feedback from a friend.

Skill: Football

I consider myself proficient in football, particularly in my ability to read the game, my passing accuracy, and my offensive awareness on the field. Over the years, I have played both casually and competitively, which has helped me develop a strong understanding of game tactics and positioning. I'm a creative playmaker , often communicating well with teammates to create scoring opportunities.

However, I recognize areas for improvement, such as my shooting consistency ,stamina and defensive skills. While I can contribute significantly in midfield, I sometimes struggle to finish chances and may overthink my approach during critical moments. Overall, I feel confident in my abilities but know that there’s always room for growth and improvement.

Peer Analysis
-
Friend’s Analysis:

I asked my friend, who has played alongside me in various matches, to evaluate my football skills. Here’s what they said:

“He said Shahbaz is a solid football player. He has a great understanding of the game and makes smart decisions on the field. His passing is one of his strongest abilities ; he can find players in tight spaces effectively. However, I think he sometimes underestimates the importance of working on his shooting. There are moments when he has clear opportunities to score but hesitates or shot goes wide. Additionally, while he’s good in midfield, he could improve his defensive skills to become a more well-rounded player. Overall, he’s talented, but there’s definitely potential for him to become even better.”

Comparison of Analyses
-
Both analyses emphasize strengths in game understanding, passing ability, and teamwork. My self-assessment highlights my playmaking skills  and strategic thinking, while my friend acknowledges my decision-making on the field. However, both analyses point out my shooting and defensive skills as areas for improvement.

My friend’s feedback adds depth to my self-analysis, indicating that my awareness of my weaknesses is accurate but that I might not fully appreciate how crucial these areas are to my overall performance.

Reflection on the Dunning-Kruger Effect
-
The Dunning-Kruger Effect suggests that individuals with limited abilities may overestimate their skills, while those who are more competent might underestimate themselves. In my case, I feel confident in my football abilities, recognizing both strengths and weaknesses. However, my friend’s insights reveal that I may have underestimated the importance of improving my shooting and defensive skills.

Reflecting on this, I don’t think i have the severe version of the Dunning-Kruger Effect, but I do see how I might have been overly optimistic about certain aspects of my game. This feedback reinforces the idea that I should actively work on my weaknesses and seek out constructive criticism to continue improving. It highlights the need for development, reminding me that being good at something doesn’t mean there isn’t room to grow.

For example, when I believe a certain diet is healthy, I look for articles that praise it and ignore studies that show its downsides. This made me less open to trying other healthier options.

2. Anchoring Bias: I sometimes rely too much on the first piece of information I receive. When I was shopping for a car, the first price I saw influenced my judgment about what I should pay. I thought it was a good deal, even when I later found better prices. This caused me to miss out on a more affordable option.

3. Availability Heuristic: I tend to judge how common something is based on how easily examples come to mind. After hearing news stories about airplane accidents, I felt anxious about flying, even though statistics show it’s safe. This bias made me avoid traveling by air even when I wanted to go places.

4. Hindsight Bias: After an event, I often think I knew how it would turn out all along. For instance, after a sports game where my team lost, I felt like I understood their mistakes better than I did before the game. This made me less likely to learn from my mistakes since I thought I had it all figured out.

5. Dunning-Kruger Effect: At times, I have felt overconfident about my skills, especially when I first started learning something new. For example, when I began cooking, I thought I was doing great.

0 Marks: Does not identify or explain the bias.","All right! Here are five biases I have experienced personally and how they affected me:

### 1. Confirmation Bias
**Experience:** While studying for some test, I noted that I read more materials that agreed with my understanding on some topics as opposed to sources offering the opposite views. For example, I read articles that said my method of studying was right, but research saying otherwise about other ways to study was completely ignored.

**Effect:** This inclination made me narrow down to a very small approach, which eventually weakened my performance. When the examination contained concepts that I hadn't explored thoroughly, I didn't fare well for those questions, thinking only later that I should have taken a more balanced approach to studying.

### 2. Anchoring Bias
**Experience:** In a salary negotiation for a new position, the first salary I mentioned was the anchor of my expectations, given that it pegged all my subsequent thinking. Though my credentials and market research suggested that I was going to earn much more in my role than was provided in the first offer, I just could not bring it up and plead for a better offer.

**Effect:** This anchoring bias saw me compromise on getting a lower salary than worth. It took me some time to figure out the impact that had when settling with that number, then realizing later on that if I had negotiated using broader market data, I would have gotten away with more.

### 3. Sunk Cost Fallacy
This was the nature of my experience: Once, in class, I worked on a huge amount of time and resources put into a group project. As the project progressed, it then became very apparent that we were not on the right track; going further would most likely yield poor results. Still, I felt compelled to push forward because of the effort already invested.

**Effect:** Because of this fallacy of the sunk cost, we wasted more time and resources to no avail. Had we known the mistakes early and changed our approach, we would have emerged with a better grade. I learned to be able to cut losses in the future and reassess.
**Experience:** Hearing news of several major train accidents, I, somehow, always worried unnecessarily, even about my security when I used the public train services. Those pictures in the news influenced my perception of risk.

**Effect:** This made me highly anxious and hesitant to use public transport even though, statistically, it continued to be one of the safest forms of commuting. The fear became too much in relation to real danger and thus started governing my everyday decisions and actions.

### 5. Dunning-Kruger Effect
**Experience:** In the beginning stages of my career, I found myself very self-confident regarding my professional skills and thought I knew what was expected out of me in the job. For years, I continued to volunteer on work-related assignments that were substantially above my pay grade, which I believed I was competent enough for.

This implies that oversubscription led to quite a few errors that I learned much later from even more experienced colleagues' comments and feedbacks. This became quite a humbling experience that made me realize the importance of realizing my own limitations of knowing and asking for help when appropriate. This helped me to take on new tasks with a mentality of continuous learning rather than presumption.

These biases illustrate how our thinking and decision-making may be interfered with by cognitive short cuts and emotional issues. It is through these kinds of biases about myself that I have been able to approach many of my choices and contacts in life rather more reflectively.",10,"The answer demonstrates a clear understanding of each bias and provides relevant and valid incidents from the student's life that correctly illustrate each bias.

Confirmation bias is the tendency to search for, interpret, and favor information that supports one’s existing beliefs while ignoring or dismissing evidence to the contrary. I experienced this bias when I was deciding whether to invest in a particular stock. I was already convinced that the stock was going to perform well, so I primarily sought out articles, forums, and expert opinions that confirmed my belief. Even though some sources pointed out potential risks or downturns, I ignored them, which led to poor investment decisions and financial losses.

Effect: I made less informed decisions because I filtered out important information that didn't align with my expectations, leading to financial consequences.

2. Dunning-Kruger Effect:

This bias occurs when individuals with limited knowledge or expertise in an area overestimate their own abilities. Early in my career, I took on a project that required skills I wasn’t fully experienced with, such as data analysis. I believed I could handle the task easily, but as I progressed, I realized I had overestimated my proficiency and struggled to meet the project’s demands. I had to spend extra time learning, which affected the project’s timeline.

Effect: Overestimating my abilities led to underperformance and delayed project completion, as I wasn’t prepared for the challenges I encountered.

3. Sunk Cost Fallacy:

The sunk cost fallacy is when someone continues investing time, effort, or money into a failing venture because they’ve already committed significant resources. I experienced this bias when working on a side project that was clearly not going to meet its goals. I had already invested months of work and some financial resources, so I kept pushing forward, even though the project was no longer viable. Eventually, I had to accept that continuing was a waste of time and effort.

Effect: I wasted time and energy on a project that should have been abandoned earlier because I was too focused on the resources I had already invested.

4. Halo Effect:

The halo effect is when the positive attributes of a person or product influence your overall impression of them, even in areas unrelated to those attributes. I once worked with a colleague who was particularly charismatic and socially skilled. Because of these positive traits, I initially assumed they were also highly competent in their work. However, after several projects, I realized that their actual job performance didn’t match my initial positive impression.

Effect: I trusted this person with important tasks early on, only to realize later that their performance was below expectations. My initial judgment based on unrelated traits led to poor delegation choices.

5. Recency Bias:

Recency bias is the tendency to give disproportionate weight to recent events compared to earlier ones. I noticed this bias when reviewing my performance over a year. I tended to focus more on recent accomplishments and challenges rather than considering my performance over the full period. Because of this, I overlooked some earlier achievements and setbacks, leading me to skew my self-assessment and set goals that weren’t fully aligned with the entire year’s progress.

Effect: My self-assessment became skewed, which affected how I set goals for improvement and recognized my overall growth.",10,"The answer demonstrates a clear understanding of each bias and provides relevant and valid incidents from the student's life to illustrate the impact of each bias.

**Experience:** I can think of many instances when I fell into the trap of confirmation bias, especially in terms of politics. I love articles and videos that support my opinions and feel good by having validation about my opinions. If something opposes the statements or if a different argument supports it, then most of the time I usually dismiss it and say that is already biased.

**Impact:** That made me adverse to listening to opposing views, which normally ended in heated discussions with friends. I would catch myself saying something like, ""I don't have to listen to that. I am right!"" On reflection, I think that limited my understanding of complex matters and stifled some really interesting discussions that I could have had.

### 2. Anchoring Bias

**Experience:** You notice the first price right in front of you while buying gadgetry, so it grabs your attention. You start with an example such as the first phone that you see, which costs Rs 63,000. Now, although you later find much cheaper or better options, you start continuing to base yourself on that price.

**Imapct:** This sometimes makes me miss really good deals. I remember feeling really bad after realizing you overpaid for something because something was just too hard to get out of your mind. It is a good reminder to step back and have everything critically assessed a lot more before taking action.


### 3. Availability Heuristic

**Experience:** Hearing a few episodes of airplane crashes on the news instilled in me a serious fear of air travel. Though I knew statistics favored safety in air travel, those vivid sensational reports made me really anxious every time I had to board a plane.

**Impact:** Typically, it was a cause that led to avoiding traveling at all, with tons of undue pressure that mounted. I could vividly remember sitting in the airports with my heart pounding even when I knew logically that flying was one of the safest ways. It took me some time to reflect that my perception was skewed by something that I had recently heard rather than the actual reality.

### 4. Gambler's Fallacy

**Experience:** The gambler's fallacy has been experienced by me, too, when playing games like roulette. For example, if I saw red come up some times consecutively, I'd be thinking, ""Okay, black has to hit soon."" I convinced myself that the odds were bound to level out.

**Impact:** It led to some very disappointing betting decisions and losses. I used to think I had a good bet coming my way and would chase my bets. Eventually, I learned the hard way that every spin of a roulette is independent of the last one; this has helped keep me more clear-headed when I play.

### 5. Sunk Cost Fallacy

**Experience:** I remember one instance where I was involved in a group work that never came to be. After it was quite evident that we were just going around in circles, I stayed back not wanting to let go of all the time and energy that had been put into it.


**Impact:** I kept telling myself, ""We have gone this far; we can't give in at this point!"" However, it simply consumed more time and energy. It taught me when to be the wise one and cut your losses while you concentrate on what will be best in the future, not on holding on to what is past investments.

Confirmation Bias Exerience: While researching a topic, I often seek out information that supports my existing beliefs and ignoring evidence that contradicts them. For example, when considering a political issue, I concentrate toward articles and sources that aligned with my views, ignoring opposing perspectives. This bias limits my understanding of the issue and reinforced my preconceived notions, making it harder to engage in constructive conversations with others who held different views. It created a sort of echo chamber that stifled my ability to consider alternative viewpoints.

2.Availability Heuristic Experience: I tend to overestimate the likelihood of events based on how easily I can recall similar instances. For instance, after hearing about a few airplane accidents in the news, I became concious about flying, despite statistics showing it is a safe mode of transportation. This bias led to unnecessary anxiety and impacted my decision-making, making me hesitant to travel. I realized later that my fear was based on vivid but rare occurrences rather than an accurate logictic of risk.

Sunk Cost Fallacy Experience: I once invested a lot of time and money into a project that was clearly failing, but I hesitated to cut my losses because of the effort I had already put in. I kept trying to make it work, thinking I couldn’t abandon what I had already invested. This bias caused me to waste even more resources and time on a project that had little chance of success. Eventually, I learned that it’s often better to recognize when to walk away rather than cling to past investments.

Overconfidence Bias Experience: I have sometimes overestimated my abilities, especially when starting new tasks. For example, I thought I could quickly master a complex software program without much practice or study, believing my previous experience would suffice. This overconfidence led to frustration when I struggled to use the software effectively. I realized that my assumption of being able to pick it up easily hindered my willingness to seek help or take the time to learn properly.

Bandwagon Effect Experience:I have found myself adopting popular opinions or trends just because they were widely accepted. For instance, I joined a fitness craze that everyone around me was doing, even though it didn’t align with my personal interests.

I am definitely guilty of succumbing to the temptations of confirmation bias when researching topics or making an opinion about something that matters to me. This means that if I believed in a particular technology or platform, I read and looked out for articles and reviews that concurred with my views while underplaying those that seemed more critical about it. This has, in a few instances, made me possess a far tighter view of issues that are far from simple where, through this, I was not always open to counter viewpoints.
 
2. Availability Heuristic

What's the basic idea:The tendency to judge the likelihood of an event based on how easily examples come to mind; this is often influenced by recent exposure or emotional intensity.
How it affected me:

This bias has influenced the way in which I make decisions-for example, irrationally fearing to fly after having seen a plan crash on television. Although I am much more likely to die in a car, the dramatic character and vividness of the aircraft's accident made me overestimate its probability and, for a period, determines how I feel about flying.

3.  Sunk Cost Fallacy

This is the desire to continue investing in a decision or project purely because of the resources already sunk into it, even if it becomes obvious that the decision is not sustainable.
How it affected me:

I fell prey to the sunk cost fallacy when I persisted with hobbies, projects, or even relationships that seemed only to drag me down since I did not want to waste a resource already spent in time or money.
It took such a long time for one to understand that making cuts would have been better than spending one's resources into something which does not seem to be panning out.

4. Halo Effect

Definition: The tendency to let an overall favorable impression of somebody or something guide judgments about their specific traits or abilities.
How it affected me:For instance, I was familiar with the positive halo when it came to social levels-for example, the sense where I gave a good impression about people by just having one favorable characteristic, being friendly. Then, other aspects of behavior or even competencies didn't go well along with that. This specific bias made me commit sometimes to trust some individuals or grant merit to their ideas faster than it could be done without fully judging their capabilities.

5.Dunning-Kruger Effect This psychological bias arises when incompetent persons overestimate their abilities, and vice versa with high-ability people.

How it has impacted me:There were domains that had left me to learn regarding technical issues or new software, so initially, I had a very high level of confidence in my abilities and thought I really understood things. But with every layer of depth that I gain, I come to realize there's much to learn, and these new responsibilities of knowledge made me more aware of my weaknesses. And on the other side, where I felt capable, I diminished the depth of knowledge I actually needed because I thought it was all well-known. But of course, there's the Dunning-Kruger Effect to add to the list. It encompasses some of the above biases influencing decision making and perception of other people but in some ways and to a limited extent even perception of oneself and confidence about abilities.",10,"The answer demonstrates a clear understanding of each bias and provides relevant and valid incidents from the student's life that correctly illustrate each bias.

I ignored negative reviews that highlighted potential issues with that brand's latest model. As a result, I ended up with a smartphone that had some of the issues I had previously ignored.\n\n2.

Description: The tendency to search for, interpret, and remember information in a way that confirms one’s preexisting beliefs or hypotheses.
Personal Experience: During group discussions or debates, I often found myself seeking out data or examples that supported my opinion while dismissing or downplaying evidence that contradicted it. This made me feel more confident about my stance but likely limited my ability to learn from opposing perspectives. For instance, when researching a purchase, I tended to read more reviews that reinforced my desire to buy the product, ignoring negative ones.

2 Availability Heuristic
Description: The tendency to judge the frequency or probability of events based on how easily examples come to mind.
Personal Experience: After watching news reports about plane crashes, I felt an irrational fear of flying, despite knowing statistically that air travel is safer than driving. The vividness of recent media coverage made me overestimate the likelihood of a crash, causing unnecessary anxiety before flying. This bias has influenced my perception of risk in other areas, such as crime rates in a neighborhood after hearing about a local incident.

3.The Halo Effect
Description: The tendency to allow an overall impression of a person (often based on one characteristic) to influence judgments about other traits.
Personal Experience: When working with someone who was particularly charismatic and well-spoken, I initially assumed they were also highly competent at their job. Later, I realized that their performance in specific tasks was not as strong as I had first assumed. Their positive personality traits made it hard for me to critically evaluate their abilities objectively, leading to misplaced expectations.

4.Sunk Cost Fallacy
Description: The tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment in money, effort, or time has been made, even when continuing is not the best course of action.
Personal Experience: I’ve experienced this bias when sticking with a project or hobby for too long simply because I had already invested a lot of time and energy into it. For example, I stayed with a complicated DIY project that wasn’t going well because I had already spent weeks working on it. Despite realizing that it wasn’t going to be worth the outcome, I felt compelled to finish it because of the time and effort I had already spent, rather than cutting my losses.

5.The Dunning-Kruger Effect
Description: A cognitive bias where individuals with low ability in a particular area overestimate their knowledge or competence.
Personal Experience: Early in my learning process for coding, I felt like I had mastered certain programming concepts after just a few tutorials. I would overestimate my ability to solve more complex problems, only to struggle later when faced with real-world challenges. This led to frustration because I hadn’t realized how much more I needed to learn. Over time, I became more aware of my knowledge gaps, and I learned to assess my skills more accurately.

   1.Confirmation Bias: This is the tendency to seek out 
    information that confirms our existing beliefs. For 
    instance, I might have a strong opinion about a particular 
    political issue. Instead of considering diverse perspectives, 
    I find myself gravitating toward articles and discussions 
    that support my viewpoint, reinforcing my beliefs and 
    making me less open to opposing ideas.

   2.Anchoring Bias: This bias occurs when we rely too 
    heavily on the first piece of information we encounter. I 
    once participated in a negotiation where the initial price 
    set the tone for the rest of the discussion. Despite 
    research suggesting a more reasonable price, I felt 
    anchored to the original number, which influenced my 
    judgment and led to a less favorable outcome.

   3.Availability Heuristic: This bias involves relying on 
    immediate examples that come to mind when evaluating a 
    topic. After hearing news stories about rare accidents, I 
    started to perceive traveling as riskier than it actually is. 
    This skewed my perception, leading to unnecessary 
    anxiety about flying, even though statistically, it remains 
    one of the safest modes of transportation.

   4.Sunk Cost Fallacy: This bias leads us to continue an 
    endeavor because of the invested resources (time, money, 
    effort), rather than evaluating it objectively. I once held 
    onto a subscription service I rarely used simply because I 
    had paid for a year upfront. This caused me to waste 
    additional money rather than canceling and reallocating 
    those funds to something more valuable.

   5.Dunning-Kruger Effect: This cognitive bias involves 
    overestimating one’s knowledge or ability in a specific 
    area. Early in my career, I was confident in my skills, 
    believing I had a firm grasp on my field. This led to 
    complacency and resistance to feedback, which hindered 
    my growth. It wasn't until I started seeking mentorship that 
    I recognized the gaps in my knowledge.",10,The answer correctly identifies and explains each of the five biases with relevant and valid incidents from the student's life.

Personal Experience: During group discussions or debates, I often found myself seeking out data or examples that supported my opinion while dismissing or downplaying evidence that contradicted it. This made me feel more confident about my stance but likely limited my ability to learn from opposing perspectives. For instance, when researching a purchase, I tended to read more reviews that reinforced my desire to buy the product, ignoring negative ones.

2 Availability Heuristic Description: The tendency to judge the frequency or probability of events based on how easily examples come to mind. Personal Experience: After watching news reports about plane crashes, I felt an irrational fear of flying, despite knowing statistically that air travel is safer than driving. The vividness of recent media coverage made me overestimate the likelihood of a crash, causing unnecessary anxiety before flying. This bias has influenced my perception of risk in other areas, such as crime rates in a neighborhood after hearing about a local incident.

3.The Halo Effect Description: The tendency to allow an overall impression of a person (often based on one characteristic) to influence judgments about other traits. Personal Experience: When working with someone who was particularly charismatic and well-spoken, I initially assumed they were also highly competent at their job. Later, I realized that their performance in specific tasks was not as strong as I had first assumed. Their positive personality traits made it hard for me to critically evaluate their abilities objectively, leading to misplaced expectations.

4.Sunk Cost Fallacy Description: The tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment in money, effort, or time has been made, even when continuing is not the best course of action. Personal Experience: I’ve experienced this bias when sticking with a project or hobby for too long simply because I had already invested a lot of time and energy into it. For example, I stayed with a complicated DIY project that wasn’t going well because I had already spent weeks working on it. Despite realizing that it wasn’t going to be worth the outcome, I felt compelled to finish it because of the time and effort I had already spent, rather than cutting my losses.

5.The Dunning-Kruger Effect Description: A cognitive bias where individuals with low ability in a particular area overestimate their knowledge or competence. Personal Experience: Early in my learning process for coding, I felt like I had mastered certain programming concepts after just a few tutorials. I would overestimate my ability to solve more complex problems, only to struggle later when faced with real-world challenges. This led to frustration because I hadn’t realized how much more I needed to learn. Over time, I became more aware of my knowledge gaps, and I learned to assess my skills more accurately.

This bias affects me by making me seek out information that supports my existing beliefs while ignoring contradictory evidence. For example, when I was deciding on which smartphone to buy, I primarily looked for reviews and opinions that aligned with my preference for a particular brand. I ignored negative reviews that highlighted potential issues with that brand's latest model. As a result, I ended up with a smartphone that had some of the issues I had previously ignored.\n\n2.

This bias makes me rely on readily available information when making judgments or decisions, rather than seeking out more comprehensive or objective data.

I may overlook less talked-about destinations that could offer better experiences simply because they are not as commonly discussed.\n\n3. Anchoring Bias: Anchoring Bias has affected me in situations where I've had to negotiate, such as when discussing grades with professors or negotiating prices for items. In these instances, the first piece of information I receive (the anchor) tends to heavily influence my subsequent judgments or offers. For example, during a negotiation for a part-time job salary, I anchored my salary expectations based on what I earned in a previous job, rather than researching market rates or considering the value I could bring to the new position.

Experience - The more news articles I read with ideologies similar to my set-up mind, the higher the chances of me becoming an unconscious disseminator of biased information. Just last month, I was researching a topic that always makes me want to write. I am focused on sources that seem to support my views while ignoring the opposing viewpoints.

Effect - This bias might further narrow my understanding of delicate problems. Although I may be justified in believing it, I deprive myself of crucial points that might add to my ability in this regard and the development of my reasoning skill.

**2.Self-Enhancement Bias:**

Experience - I normally attribute the successful accomplishment of a goal to my own abilities or effort each time it happens. On the other hand, whenever something fails, I tend to either complain about bad luck or circumstances.

Effect -  This can inflate my self-esteem and make me resistant to constructive criticism. It hinders my growth because I might not fully acknowledge areas where I need improvement.

**3.Anchoring Bias:**

Experience - Usually, I want to hold on to the first price I see because of a product. Suppose I get to the shop and look at a jacket which has been put at $150. Later, I go through it and find out it is on offer at $100. In this case, I tend to feel that is a good price even though the market price in reality would be lower.

Effect -  This has led me to make less informed purchasing decisions, sometimes paying more than I should. I often miss out on better deals simply because I fixate on the initial anchor price.

**4.Availability Heuristic:**

Experience - Since I had heard news reports of several high-profile cyberattacks, I was becoming extremely concerned about my online security even though, statistically, I stood little chance of being targeted.

Effect - The effect is that I wasted time and other resources in terms of security measures that, perhaps, were not necessary, while I ignored more serious concerns in my digital life.

**5.Bandwagon Effect:**

Experience - When some new social media site or trend really starts blowing up, I feel the greatest compulsion to at least check it out, even though I wouldn't necessarily have had an interest in using it otherwise. Like how I got on TikTok despite no compelling desire to create or consume that content.


Effect - This took up a large amount of time on platforms that didn't really add value to my life but rather made me feel obligated to use them. I learned that many times I tend to seek validation from others more than I enjoy a particular activity.

- 
Whenever I seek out a product to purchase, chances are I will be concentrating more on the reviews and feedback that support the brand or model of my choice. The more I like a certain product the more I will want to know about it, scouring everything to find positive views that will help in supporting that choice and further firming up belief in the fact that the one I have chosen is indeed the best. Even as I found negative reviews, I always tend to downplay or dismiss them because I might believe that's just a very small probability case. This allows me to have the ability to be more confident in what I am doing even when I tend to choose to ignore important information. This makes me go into a sort of tunnel vision wherein I don't judge the product the way I should judge it for a fair assessment due to my tendency to want to justify my first preference.

Survivorship Bias
- 
Most of the success stories I hear related to finance are from people who made a killing by profiting on a particular investment in a certain stock or on a follow-the-trend basis. At times, such stories make me feel that if only I took the same risks, I could be the one next time. One would easily be swept by the excitement from those stories and believe that making money in a stock market is common or easy than it is in reality. On the other hand, what is often ignored are stories of losses, especially when markets start plummeting. It is the winners whom we hear about, but never the losers, who got bankrupted from alike investments. This makes me realize how easy it is to minimize the real risks associated with investments because the failures fade away while the survivors attract all the attention.

Better than Average Bias
-
Sometimes as a student, I catch myself thinking that I am smarter, or make better grades than my peers, even though that isn't necessarily always reflected in the grades. I think ""I do not have to study as much as others,"" or ""I can handle it at the last minute,"" because I assume that I can manage that with little effort. It often makes me procrastinate because of overconfidence in my brain or in my abilities; I keep on putting it forward as something that would be completed if I get to do it at the last minute.
Finally, I end up not working enough to do very well because I am too sure that I would automatically succeed even with minimal preparation. And this becomes a vicious cycle: I always tend to underestimate the amount of effort it really takes to shine and then when things don't go right as I expected, easy excuses pop up instead of coming to the realization that it was because I didn't work hard enough or make enough time.

Commitment Bias
-
For example, the very costly pair of shoes that turned out to not be good for my feet, where I wear them knowing that my feet are killing me in them. ""I spent so much on this; I'm not going to waste all that money"" is the kind of mindset which makes me justify my decision.
I end up holding on to the idea that because I spent money on them, they should continue to serve me well. I will also convince myself to such an extent that I can ""break them in"" or that the pain is only temporary and should not change my mind about using the shoes. This logic puts me into a trap of wearing the shoes that do not help me just because I feel I need to justify the investment done.


The Representativeness Bias
- 
When I come across a person who is silent and quiet, my first judgment that pops into my mind most times is that the person must be shy or an introvert. I depend so much on what I see in my head of what an introverted person should be: maybe someone, shunning socialization or feeling awkward with other people. However, this judgment can mislead me and cut me off from making a proper judgment of who they really are. Therefore, I might pass up some good occasions to befriend someone who, as it turns out, may be very talkative and highly energetic at other times. For example, if I invite them to a small party with friends, they can turn out to be the life of the party after some time when they get their feet wet. So instead, I may leave them out altogether or assume they wouldn't like the function, which still continues to diminish my ability to grasp who they are and what they bring in.

   Experience: I tended to read information that was in line with my present beliefs. Like once i was in a debate about climate change and I read articles that were supportive of my view on the issue and ignored pieces that would otherwise raise arguments.

   Effect: This bias limited my understanding of the topic and made me less open to new information. It reinforced my existing opinions without encouraging a more balanced perspective which hindered constructive discussions and learning opportunities.

2. **Anchoring Bias:**

  Experience: In buying decisions I have found that the price I first see most of the time convince me. Like once I was looking to buy a laptop and saw an initial high price this colored how I considered following prices.

 Effect:This made me feel false while making choices and there was a disconnection between the things that I was interested in and those that I pretended to have an interest in. Sometimes I liked the activities or the hot topics yet I could sense that most of the times I was sacrificing my true preferences for being in mainstream and this reduced my level of satisfaction altogether.

3. **Sunk Cost Fallacy:**

Experience: I have met this bias when undergoing a tution that I had paid for but was not benefiting to me. Though I understood that I was deriving nothing from it I still continued the attendant because I had already invested both money and time into it.

Effect: This made me waste time and energy that cannot be utilized for other successful oppertunitys. Recognizing this cost as already incurred and should not be my determinant factor for current choices is an uphill task and leads to feelings of frustration and regret.

4. **Commitment Bias:**

Experience: I became a member of a study group at the beginning of the academic year however during that time I wasn't really excited about working with other people. Anyway towards the end the group didn't work and I could study just fine by myself.

Effect: Out of responsibility and loss of what I assumed had already committed I had continued attending the group sessions despite my feelings about them. This cost me much more time and got me much more frustrated because that time could be well used with me thereby affecting my academics.

5. **Survivorship Bias:**

Experience: I spent most of my time listening to stories of how peers who did absolutely nothing in class obtained top grades. Their stories followed mine as I had thought that fewer study hours could bring good grades.


Effect: This kept me from giving greater importance to the amount of effort that was needed to achieve success. Every time I did horribly in an exam I felt disappointed knowing well that I had ignored the efforts actually put behind those successes.

What it is: This is the tendency to seek out or interpret information in a way that confirms our pre-existing beliefs or hypotheses.
Personal Impact: I've noticed that when researching or discussing topics I'm passionate about, I tend to give more weight to information that aligns with my preconceptions. For instance, when debating issues like technology’s role in education, I might be more inclined to read articles that confirm my positive view, potentially overlooking valid concerns or contradictory evidence.
2. Anchoring Bias

What is it? Anchoring is the tendency to anchor too heavily on the first piece of information encountered (the ""anchor"") when making decisions.

Personal Effect:

 Anchoring has indeed occurred in my experience of buying things. For instance, while buying an electronic gadget, I saw a very high price initially and used it as a reference consciously, but any subsequent price lower than that seemed like an excellent bargain, even if it was more expensive than the average market value. This actually made me purchase things that, in hindsight, were not always the most cost-effective decisions.

3. Recency Bias

What it is: This is the tendency to give more weight to the most recent information or events, even if they are not the most important or relevant.

Personal Impact:

 Recency bias often impacts my personal assessments of productivity. When I have had a good day or week, I think that things are going better for longer periods than they actually do, and when I've had a couple of bad days, I hate even my best work and make judgments about it when, in fact, I should be only getting out of bed in the morning.

4.The Halo Effect:

What it is: This bias occurs when our overall impression of someone (usually based on one trait) influences how we perceive their other traits.

Personal Impact:

 I’ve experienced the halo effect when meeting highly articulate or charismatic people. I may overestimate their expertise or integrity in other areas simply because they are well-spoken or have a certain charm. This has sometimes led to situations where I placed too much trust in someone’s judgment, only to later realize that their competence didn’t extend beyond their initial positive impression.
5. The Dunning-Kruger Effect

It is the cognitive bias in which poor performers in the execution of a task exaggerate their ability to accomplish it, while the more able believe that their ability is relatively bad.

Personal Impact:

 Earlier in my career, I sometimes underestimated the complexity of tasks and felt more confident in tackling projects without realizing how much I had yet to learn. Over time, as I gained more knowledge, I started to recognize how much more there was to learn, and my overconfidence gave way to a more measured and humble approach. It was an important realization that shaped my learning process.",10,"The answer demonstrates a clear understanding of each bias and provides relevant and valid incidents from the student's life to illustrate the impact of each bias.

0 Marks: Does not identify or explain the bias.","Here are five biases, including blind spot bias, through which I passed,  and with an explanation of how each of them affected me:

1. Blind Spot Bias

This bias describes an inability to see how others do the same thing as we do, but just do not notice how we are being biased ourselves. I have seen this kind of blind spot bias within group work-projects. We would brainstorm ideas, and I often realized that I could quickly catch on when another person was being biased against ideas due to their personal preferences-about not choosing ideas. However, I did not realize I was sometimes making those judgments; this was often the reason I rejected good ideas that were not what I thought should happen.

2.Confirmation Bias

This bias causes us to seek, to understand, and to recall information in a pattern that confirms our preconceptions. I have also experienced confirmation bias in studying for tests. Whenever I am preparing for tests or quizzes, I tend to focus more on the subjects I already understood well or believed were crucial, not paying much attention to those I thought were rather hard to grasp. Sometimes, I then fail to catch important stuff and end up poorly scoring certain questions that I hadn't been ready for.

3. Recency Bias

It has a tendency of giving more credits to recent events. This is clearly seen in, for instance, my experience during the presentation. The last few slides when presented were not as perfect as the expectation set. Though the first half went well, was very engaging, and was according to plan, I was able to give lots of credit to some of the mistakes made recently. Therefore, I thought that the whole presentation had failed as a result of the recent mistakes.


4. Anchoring Bias

Anchoring bias is to do with how we make decisions based on the first information received. I experienced this while buying goods online. More often than not, I ended up making judgements based on the first price that encountered me online even when, later on, I was presented with more effective deals that would fit into my budget. This would imply that I was less objective while analyzing prices and ended up buying stuff that weren't necessarily the best choices.

5. Fundamental Attribution Error
This bias is associated with the attributing of others' actions to their character, without considering situational factors. I have experienced such a bias when a classmate missed the deadline by which the assignment was supposed to be submitted. We attributed them to be lazy and irresponsible but failed to realize that they might have been dealing with some personal issues or other commitments. It later came out that they had been facing a family emergency, so the point hit me hard on how one could quickly judge based on limited information.

Miracle on the Hudson: Airplane Safety

Incident: US Airways Flight 1549 was on January 15, 2009, making its emergency landing onto the Hudson River after both engines of the aircraft ingested birds not long after takeoff. Hundreds of lives were at risk due to an incursion. And for that reason, ‘the baby’ pilot Chesley ‘Sully’ Sullenberger became a hero who ‘resolved the crisis in the middle of an in-flight disaster. Survivorship Bias: The safety of the airplane misperception was created only after that airplane has landed. It is clear that there are many cases where Sullenberger and his team did everything almost perfectly, but unfortunately, had poor outcomes. This one instance of the successful conclusion of the said activity does not indicate how exposed we can be when it comes to taking a flight. Lesson: Survivorship bias is only a misconception of our understanding of how reality is. To make sensible judgments and avoid irrational beliefs, it is important to look at the whole spectrum of outcomes, including those that result in failure and loss.

Imagine someone purchasing a stock that he believes will appreciate in price. Not long after the purchase, the stock begins plummeting and news is breaking that the company's long-term prospects are in serious trouble. Still, the buyer holds on to the stock or even makes additional purchases of it because he has already sunk too much money into it and doesn't want to come to realize that he made a bad call.
This is commitment bias because one person ignores new evidence and commits more resources to a poor decision to justify his initial choice.

Example of Confirmation Bias:
Visualize a person who believes that only some specific diet would assist in losing the mass. Therefore, they can only search for articles and success stories with testimonials, while the study or reports saying other diets are more effective or that the diet has a huge negative side would usually be ignored. Even when presented with science evidence that indicated some truth, they might come up with a label of an exception or biased while throwing in selective examples to back up their original point of view.

Another example
For instance, a political campaign follower during any election period might ignore or downplay news headlines or ""update"" on Facebook reporting scandals and criticisms against the political candidate they like, but amplify or take seriously whatever negative reports they hear about their opponent, even though such information may not be credible at all.


Example Of Conjugation Fallacy:
Eiracle on the Hudson: Airplane Safety

Incident: US Airways Flight 1549 was airlifted to the Hudson River on January 15, 2009, after both engines of the aircraft ordered by the captain were struck with birds shortly after take off. There was an incursion posed to hundreds of lives. It is because of this that ‘the baby’ pilot Chesley ‘Sully’ Sullenberger is a hero as he ‘brought the situation under control while the crisis was in the course of an in-flight emergency’. Survivor Bais: The delusion of the airplane's safety was engendered after the airplane has touched down. It is evident that there are several instances where Sullenberger and his crew performed almost all the tasks admirably, but regrettably, such instances turned out badly. This single case of the successful termination of the above mentioned activity does not give an indication of how safe engaging in such an activity is. Deduction: Everybody tends to overestimate the survivorship bias. Toward that end, it is essential to consider all the possible outcomes, even those that involve adverse consequences, in order to form reasonable views and avoid emotional ones.


Example of Barnum Effect:
Imagine a man reading the horoscope in a newspaper. Horoscope will tell him something like: 

You have a great need to be appreciated and admired by others; however you can very well be overly critical of yourself. You have such a strong capacity that you never used much of it. At times, you feel you made wrong choices, but you do have what it takes to get through stuff and reach your goals.
This description is so general and can be described in almost everybody, yet it makes a reader feel as if it's narrating specifically to him or her. They'll feel to be saying it, ""Wow, that is so true!"" even though it's a general statement and can be described by a wide range of people.

This effect often is abused in astrology, fortune telling, personality tests, and many other pseudosciences for the purpose of giving the impression to people that they are being individually understood while each statement may apply to nearly anyone.

This bias affects me by making me seek out information that supports my existing beliefs while ignoring contradictory evidence. For example, when I was deciding on which smartphone to buy, I primarily looked for reviews and opinions that aligned with my preference for a particular brand. I ignored negative reviews that highlighted potential issues with that brand's latest model. As a result, I ended up with a smartphone that had some of the issues I had previously ignored.\n\n2. Availability Heuristic: The Availability Heuristic has also impacted my decision-making. This bias makes me rely on readily available information when making judgments or decisions, rather than seeking out more comprehensive or objective data. For instance, when choosing a travel destination, I often base my decision on recent stories or experiences shared by friends and family. I may overlook less talked-about destinations that could offer better experiences simply because they are not as commonly discussed.\n\n3. Anchoring Bias: Anchoring Bias has affected me in situations where I've had to negotiate, such as when discussing grades with professors or negotiating prices for items. In these instances, the first piece of information I receive (the anchor) tends to heavily influence my subsequent judgments or offers. For example, during a negotiation for a part-time job salary, I anchored my salary expectations based on what I earned in a previous job, rather than researching market rates or considering the value I could bring to the new position. This bias may have limited my ability to negotiate a fair and competitive salary.\n\n4. Overconfidence Bias: Overconfidence Bias has sometimes led me to overestimate my abilities or knowledge in certain situations. For instance, when preparing for exams, I've occasionally felt overly confident in my understanding of the material, which led me to spend less time reviewing certain topics. This bias can result in underestimating the difficulty of the exam and negatively impact my performance.\n\n5. Recency Effect: The Recency Effect influences how I remember and prioritize information. In academic settings, I tend to give more weight to information or concepts covered recently in lectures or readings, while inadvertently overlooking earlier material. This bias can affect my ability to grasp the entirety of a subject or course, as I may not fully integrate earlier learning with new information.\n\nOverall, these biases have shown me how our minds naturally tend to take shortcuts in processing information, often leading to decisions that may not always be as objective or well-informed as they could be.

*Effect:* While studying for exams, I tended to focus on notes and resources that reinforced what I already understood, neglecting topics I struggled with. This limited my preparation and hurt my overall performance.   

**2. Availability Heuristic**

*Effect:* After hearing about a few classmates getting poor grades on a particular test, I became anxious about my performance in that subject. I overestimated how common it was to fail, which affected my confidence during the exam.   

**3. Anchoring Bias**

*Effect:* During group projects, the first idea proposed often shaped our discussions. I found myself fixating on the initial suggestion, even when better alternatives were presented later, which limited our project's creativity.   

**5. Sunk Cost Fallacy**

*Effect:* I continued spending hours on a project that was clearly going off track because I had already invested so much time. Instead of pivoting to a new idea, I pushed through, resulting in a subpar final product.   

**5. Bandwagon Effect**

*Effect:* When a popular study method gained traction among my peers, I adopted it without considering whether it suited my learning style. I wasted time on a technique that wasn’t effective for me, which ultimately hurt my study efficiency.

My friend was quite excited in deciding to adopt a particular diet program that would help her to lose a little weight in just a very short period of time. She had spent days surfing the internet to garner all the details related to the new diet she had opted for. She had, however, mostly browsed for articles and success stories in which the diet program was highlighted as essential. The one illustrating case studies or review based on adverse effects or futility of the diet was ignored.

How Confirmation Bias Emerged:
Confirmation bias takes the shape of a search strategy only for information that confirms some belief in advance. She reads only stories that reflected her conviction of succeeding on the diet and publishes only positive stories on social network media, reinforcing her resolve to continue with the diet and allows ignoring all warnings and criticism about the diet.

#### **Result of Confirmation Bias:**
After this, my friend really became very disappointed since after quite some weeks, she could not find any apparent results. And instead of discrediting the value of the diet or to seek something else and effective, she pushed more, once she failed to get whatever was promised in the diet, she remained disappointed and disillusioned with dieting at large. This eventually led to a kind of irrelevance in dieting for her, and she did not come out of this experience, learning something from it.

### **Case in Point #2: Political Views**

A passionate advocate of the candidate, very vocal about his support will find all he can for the right candidate during election times. He would write stuff online saying that this was the greatest candidate, and all the others running against him are not good people. He spent a long time digging into everything that fueled what he believed in and discounting all the rest as spurious or biased.

It also exhibits confirmation bias in that he or she concentrated only on those points, which were relevant to his or her political beliefs, while at the same time ignoring those other points that would oppose what he believes. The speaker was merely an echo chamber by speaking only to those who are just like him so that it could build up his conviction but reduce the potential of encountering counter voices.

#### **Consequence of Confirmation Bias:  
Quickly, that friend dug themselves in further to what now had become accepted truth; loud arguments with friends and family would result because another candidate had been liked. For not seeking an alternative perspective promoted divisiveness in relationships and gave way to a polarized view of the election; thus, the potential ability to have healthy discussions about politics was lessened.

He often shared his figure drawings on social media and received mixed feedback. Deva  focused on the positive comments that praised his figure work and often showcased those pieces. Whenever someone pointed out anatomical inaccuracies or suggested he study proportion more carefully, he viewed those critiques as irrelevant or as jealousy. He continued to draw figures without addressing these weaknesses, telling himself that his unique style made up for any technical flaws.

Result: As a result, Deva's illustrations began to attract a niche audience, but he found it increasingly difficult to gain recognition in broader art circles. When he submitted his work to an art collective, he received harsh feedback about his technical skills. Deva felt disheartened and defensive, failing to see how his confirmation bias had kept him from improving. Ultimately, this hindered his opportunities for collaboration and growth in his artistic journey.

The student focused on the positive feedback and ignored constructive criticism from their art teacher and other classmates. They only sought out opinions that confirmed their belief in their drawing style’s superiority.

Result: The student did not improve their skills as much as they could have. By ignoring valuable feedback, they missed opportunities to learn new techniques and refine their style. This ultimately limited their growth as an artist and their ability to produce more diverse and technically proficient work",10,"The answer demonstrates a clear understanding of confirmation bias and provides two relevant situations where it occurred.

A friend of mine was very optimistic about the growth of renewable energy companies. He strongly believed that these companies were the future of energy and, because of this, only sought out articles and expert opinions that confirmed his belief that investing in renewable energy stocks would yield high returns. He ignored or dismissed reports that highlighted the short-term risks, market volatility, or competition from other energy sources.

How Confirmation Bias Occurred: He only looked for information that supported his preconceived beliefs about renewable energy and avoided contrary viewpoints or data that suggested potential risks. Even when he came across articles that mentioned issues within the sector, he rationalized them as temporary setbacks.

Result: As a result of this confirmation bias, he invested heavily in a few renewable energy stocks, but when the market faced a downturn due to regulatory changes and supply chain disruptions, his investments lost significant value. He had overlooked the potential risks because he was too focused on reinforcing his optimistic view.

Situation 2: Job Interview Decision
During a hiring process, a manager was very impressed by a candidate’s résumé, which aligned perfectly with the company’s needs. The manager believed that this candidate would be the best fit for the role based on their qualifications and prior experience. During the interview, the manager focused on the candidate’s responses that confirmed their initial impression of competence, and downplayed or overlooked any signs that the candidate might lack certain interpersonal skills or might not be a team player.

How Confirmation Bias Occurred: The manager selectively paid attention to the answers that aligned with their pre-existing belief that this candidate was the right choice. Any red flags that arose during the interview, such as vague answers to teamwork questions, were dismissed as unimportant, since they didn’t fit with the manager’s initial positive judgment.

Result: The candidate was hired but later struggled to work effectively with the team, leading to poor communication and decreased productivity. The manager’s confirmation bias had led them to focus on validating their initial impression, rather than thoroughly evaluating all aspects of the candidate’s suitability for the job.

Sarah perceived that her friend, Emily, was ignoring her because the two had been fighting for quite long. Sarah appeared to always be finding out every tiny little thing Emily was doing to seem disinterested-that is, taking so much time to reply back, or being very quiet. She viewed them as factualities that Emily was angry with her. But when Emily asked her to hang out, Sarah ignored this; she was just being polite to her and didn't really care to be with her.

Confirmation Bias: Sarah was building behavior that confirmed for her that Emily was avoiding her, yet she wasn't paying attention to all the signs that were in fact contradicting the same.

Outcome: The tension feeling that Sarah had worried about did not actually exist at all. What Emily was doing was work, and when they started discussing it over time, it only proved to be a misinterpretation. Confirmation bias makes her misinterpret some neutral behavior with something bad about someone.

**Situation 2: Political Debates with Family**

John had opinions on political issues which, during the family reunions, he never failed to debate with his uncle, who held a contrary view. Always reading news and social media, John stuck to only articles that would prove his point, strictly avoiding anything from the other side. He dismissed whatever fact his uncle presented against John's worldview and never even cared to hear them.

Confirmation Bias: John listens only to what he wants his political ideology to be, dismissed or downplayed what he did not want his political ideology to be.

Outcome: This made the political conversations between them irreconcilable, and ensured that John and his uncle never had substantial talks over politics. His confirmation bias kept the entire expanse of John away from wisdom, and their argument more fiery, rather than deliberate discussion.",10,"The answer provides two relevant situations illustrating confirmation bias, showing a clear understanding of the concept and its impact.

In this regard, confirmation bias emerged because the individual would only look and accept information that met their premise of the situation not being serious. Therefore, they delayed rushing to the hospital, which elongated their anxiety, making them more suffer even though the situation was a little bit more serious than that the individual had first thought of. Thus, the individual utilized selective search to find supportive evidence that would rather prevent the individual from making appropriate action.

She often shared her figure drawings on social media and received mixed feedback. Merlin focused on the positive comments that praised her figure work and often showcased those pieces. Whenever someone pointed out anatomical inaccuracies or suggested she study proportion more carefully, she viewed those critiques as irrelevant or as jealousy. She continued to draw figures without addressing these weaknesses, telling herself that her unique style made up for any technical flaws.

Result: As a result, Merlin illustrations began to attract a niche audience, but she found it increasingly difficult to gain recognition in broader art circles. When she submitted her work to an art collective, she received harsh feedback about her technical skills. Merlin felt disheartened and defensive, failing to see how her confirmation bias had kept her from improving. Ultimately, this hindered her opportunities for collaboration and growth in her artistic journey.

Confirmation Bias 2 : Specific Situation: An art student believes that their drawing style is superior to others in their class. They have received positive feedback from a few classmates and their family. The student focused on the positive feedback and ignored constructive criticism from their art teacher and other classmates. They only sought out opinions that confirmed their belief in their drawing style’s superiority.

Result: The student did not improve their skills as much as they could have. By ignoring valuable feedback, they missed opportunities to learn new techniques and refine their style.

**Specific Situation:**

A friend strongly supports a particular political party and follows social media accounts that consistently post content favoring that party’s policies. They frequently share articles, memes, and opinions that align with their political views.

**How Confirmation Bias Occurred:**

Instead of seeking information from diverse sources, my friend mainly follows media outlets that confirm their existing beliefs. They actively avoid news or opinions from the opposing party, dismissing them as biased or unreliable. This selective exposure reinforces their belief that their preferred party is always right and that the opposing party is always wrong.

**Result of Confirmation Bias:**

This led to a narrow perspective on political issues. My friend became more entrenched in their views and less willing to engage in discussions with people holding different opinions. It also limited their ability to understand the full spectrum of issues and perspectives, which could have provided a more balanced view of political events.

# Situation 2: Health and Diet Choices
**Specific Situation:**

A family member believed that a specific diet (e.g., a low-carb diet) was the most effective for weight loss and overall health. They often read articles, blogs, and watched videos that emphasized the benefits of low-carb diets, ignoring any conflicting information.

**How Confirmation Bias Occurred:**

They primarily sought out and believed in sources that confirmed their existing belief about low-carb diets. Any studies or articles highlighting the potential downsides or recommending other dietary approaches were dismissed as inaccurate or irrelevant. This biased selection of information strengthened their belief that the low-carb diet was superior to all others.

**Result of Confirmation Bias:**

As a result, they may have missed out on learning about other balanced and scientifically supported approaches to healthy eating that could have been more suitable for their lifestyle or health needs. Their rigid belief also made it harder for them to adapt to new information, even when it was supported by credible research, potentially limiting the effectiveness of their health decisions.",10,"The answer demonstrates a clear understanding of confirmation bias and provides two relevant and well-explained situations where it occurred.

In your answer, include the specific situation, how confirmation bias occurred, and what was the result of confirmation bias.
Ans: 
Specific Situation:My friend was looking for a new job. She had been promised that companies wanted to hire graduates from good, prestigious universities only. She graduated from the new and not-so-well-known institution she thought that her chances were very low since she had relevant experience and skills.
Emergence of Confirmation Bias:She remained focused only on the postings and discussions that supported her belief. Her applications were sent to companies which strictly emphasized candidates who graduated from top-tier universities, often excluding job opportunities where qualifications matched but did not focus on the background of having passed from prestigious schools. Rejections also followed, and she would take every rejection as a confirmation of her school being a liability.
Confirmation Bias Outcome: She avoided many fantastic opportunities in companies that might have hired her based more on experience than degree. She eventually landed a job, but much later than she should have because she focused so much attention on the perception that school was holding her back.
 Situation 2: Health and Diet
Specific Situation: A member of my family believes that a low-carb diet is the only way to lose weight. He sends me articles and testimonies that focus on low-carb diets while downplaying other diets that could help him.
How Confirmation Bias Occurred:When shown research that supported balanced diets or moderate-carb approaches, he dismissed them as wrong or irrelevant, saying that they're lobby statements from the food industry. He highlighted and shared people who lost weight on low-carb diets as justification for his belief.

Consequence of Confirmation Bias:Narrow focus resulted in his limited perception about nutrition but also disappointment as he found himself unable to go further once laid flat.

Effect: It spreads incorrect information, creates unnecessary anxiety, and could damage the company's reputation for no reason at all.
2. Anecdotal Evidence as the Basis for Choosing a Career Scenario: A college student is thinking about what he wants to do when he graduates. Relatively few family members have warned him that careers in the arts are unstable and financially even riskier. He doesn't conduct any research on the overall market or consider his own interests, and he settles on a seemingly ""safer"" career in engineering. Yet he wants to use art as an expression of himself.
Critical Thinking: The student tends to rely on anecdotal evidence and ignore labor market trends, personal interests, or the possibility of success in a wide range of creative activities. The student will not critically analyze the data and look for various opinions.
Results: The student might land up in a career that does not march his skills or passion and later in life might get either dissatisfied or burn out.",10,The answer provides two relevant situations where confirmation bias is evident.

Madhu, my school friend, swore by her method of studying the night before the exams. She had used it during school days and believed it was the best way for her to retain information quickly. Even after starting college, where the material was more hard, she stuck with her method of studying.

When Madhu performed well on an exam after using that method, she thought her success was because of the method, making her belief that studying the night before worked. However, when she performed poorly, she dismissed the result as bad luck or blamed the difficulty of the exam, rather than questioning the effectiveness of her study habits. She continued to seek out advice and testimonials from students who also claimed that method worked for them, while ignoring professors' and research-based advice that suggested other methods, like spaced repetition or active learning, were more effective.

As a result, Madhu’s grades suffered as more difficult courses came in, where that method wasn’t enough to thoroughly understand the material. Her confirmation bias prevented her from experimenting with new study techniques that could have improved her performance and learning retention over time.

 Focusing on One Tactic and Ignoring Other Options

My football coach firmly believed that a defensive style of play was the best strategy to win games, based on a few successful plays. Even though the team’s offensive players were strong, the coach was convinced that a more conservative, defense-first approach would lead to consistent victories.

Throughout the many tournament, the coach stuck with the defensive approach, despite the fact that many games ended in draws or close losses because the team wasn’t scoring enough goals. The coach interpreted the games where the team kept a clean sheet as confirmation that the defensive tactic was working. On the other hand, when the team struggled to score or lost due to a lack of attacking play, the coach blamed it on individual errors or tough opposition rather than considering the need to adjust the strategy. Even advice from assistant coaches or feedback from players who favored a more attacking approach was dismissed.

As a result, the team’s performance reduced. We finished mid-table in the league, well below expectations, because we weren’t using their attacking talents to their full potential. The coach’s confirmation bias toward his defensive strategy led to a rigid and one-dimensional style of play that didn’t fully exploit the team’s strengths.",10,"The answer effectively addresses two situations where confirmation bias is evident.

**Situation1:**

A young investor has a strong belief that a particular tech stock will rise significantly due to hype around a new product release. They conduct research but only pay attention to news articles and analysis that are optimistic about the company’s growth, ignoring or minimizing the warnings about potential risks like market volatility or the company's shaky financial reports. They join online forums of like-minded investors, further solidifying their belief by reading only success stories or bullish predictions.

Here, what had happened was the influence of confirmation bias, which caused the investor to screen information by only focusing on the positive aspects about the stock while downplaying the red flags.

Therefore, that investment decision they made was relatively uneducated because they threw a lot of money into the stock before the stock crashed. That would have been avoided if they had questioned all the information available, even the negative ones, in order to give a well-balanced judgment.


In both situations, confirmation bias prevented a clear objective evaluation of evidence, resulting in delayed action or financial loss. Acknowledging and minimizing this bias can also lead to improved outcomes.

**Situation 2**:

Let's say that somebody has a headache and is tired for some period. They might read on the internet about the symptoms, suspecting it might be dehydration or stress. But the further one reads, the chance to come across a forum where people with more terrible diseases, even brain tumors, have the same symptoms increases. Still concerned but wanting to feel better, they start to look selectively for stories of others whose symptoms proved benign. They quickly pay attention to every article or forum post mentioning dehydration or lack of sleep as the cause and dismiss discussions about more serious illnesses as ""rare cases.""

In this regard, confirmation bias emerged because the individual would only look and accept information that met their premise of the situation not being serious. Therefore, they delayed rushing to the hospital, which elongated their anxiety, making them more suffer even though the situation was a little bit more serious than that the individual had first thought of. Thus, the individual utilized selective search to find supportive evidence that would rather prevent the individual from making appropriate action.

1. **Sometimes you feel like you have so much more to give, but at other times you hold back and don't know why.**
- This is not such a rare experience of inadequacy or unrealised potential that many people can share with the understanding. Everyone feels they could be doing more if only they were sure enough.

2. **There are days when you really enjoy being on your own, but deep down you treasure the close relationships you have.**
Almost everyone relates to balancing private space with a connection. The statement is personal because it talks about the two sides of human nature: that of solitude and companionship.

3. **You're often harder on yourself than others realize, but your efforts don't go unnoticed by the people who matter.**
- Most people tend to be too self-critical. So it's an easy as well as perhaps not at all untrue statement that everyone is grateful for their efforts given that it's such a general statement.

4. **Life has thrown a few curveballs your way lately, but you've really shown a real strength in how you're handling things.**
- Everyone undergoes some form of hardship, and the patina of inner strength has the effect of appealing to a desire to feel competent, making this line universally flattering yet somehow private.

5. **""You seize opportunities that come to you, but you still value the comfort of routine to keep your feet on the ground.""**
- Such chord resounds in the majority of human souls: a desire for change is always welcomed, but stability is also essential. The phrase sounds close to one's life if it is the most ordinary feeling.

### Criteria for Each Example (2 marks):

#### Barnum Statement (1 mark)

1 mark: The sentence is a clear Barnum statement that is vague and general enough to apply to a wide range of people.  
Example: ""You have a strong desire to be liked by others.""

0 marks: The sentence is too specific or not a Barnum statement.  
Example: ""You enjoy hiking in the mountains every weekend.""

#### Explanation of the Barnum Effect (1 mark)

1 mark: The explanation accurately describes how and why the sentence could induce the Barnum Effect in readers.  
Example: ""This sentence is likely to induce the Barnum Effect because almost everyone desires to be liked, making it feel personally applicable to the reader.""

0 marks: The explanation is missing or does not accurately describe the Barnum Effect.  
Example: ""This sentence works because it's a fact.""","Here are five sentences that are structured to elicit the **Barnum effect**, along with explanations of why each one is apt to be affecting readers:

### 1.  ""You have a great deal of unused potential that you have yet to tap into."".
Explanation This is a very general statement which may nearly be applied to anyone since nearly everyone will have aspects of their life where they feel that they need improvement or are good at doing. The concept of ""untapped potential"" is one which is an oftentimes-used idea so that it sounds more familiar and personal to the individual.

2. ""Sometimes life's pressures are too great to handle, but you are stronger than that.""
Explanation: People very often go through feels of being overwhelmed at different times in their lives. Because the difference between feeling overwhelmed and having strength is wide enough, they can relate themselves to the statement and begin to think it's about them alone.

### 3. ""You frequently worry about what other people think of you, but subconsciously, you know who you are.""
Interpretation Most people feel some sort of insecurity about how other people view them. This obscurity makes the sentence very accessible because it forms a universal experience, which leaves the reader in a position to believe that it describes their character.

4. ""You want change and new experiences, yet you also like stability and routine.""
- **Explanation**: This sentence presents what would appear to be a paradoxical duality that most of the people would identify with: A part of them wants something new, but another abhors change and likes routine. This will connect with the readers' lives, and it's something that everybody is going to identify with, so it's very personal.

5. ""You have a few close friends whom you do really trust, but you also find it hard to let new people into your life."".
- **Example**: The vast majority of people have a small, inner circle they are willing to open up to, but generally will not with someone new. This sentence hits one over the head with all too familiar sensations, which is exactly why readers feel it to represent their social tendency.

### Why These Sentences Cause the Barnum Effect
All of these are meant to be vague and general and to apply to everybody. The descriptions, based on common experiences and feelings, reach a very large number of readers who will see themselves in the statements and feel that they are hence personalized and applied specifically for them. This is how the Barnum effect works: people tend to accept that general or even ambiguous descriptions ""apply like a glove"" to them, thereby feeling validated and connected to the text.",10,"The student's answer effectively provides 5 sentences that induce the Barnum effect, each accompanied by a clear explanation of why it would induce the effect.

0 marks: The explanation is missing or does not accurately describe the Barnum Effect.  
Example: ""This sentence works because it's a fact.""","Sentence 1: ""You have a hunger for acceptance, but you respect your independence.""
Explanation
This actually resonates very well because it talks to two of the major elements of human nature. There is the drive for social acceptance and also the need for autonomy. Both these necessities are found in most people, so it cuts across a significant population.

Why it Invokes the Barnum Effect: It resonates with many because it's a very common and common internal plight in people. Indeed, most people have felt the frustration of wanting to be part of a crowd rather than to avoid being one of them. Because it is so general, vagueness affords individual interpretation, so that people feel that what was said uniquely applies to them.
Sentence 2: ""You often feel that you have not yet reached your potential, but you are satisfied with what you have.""
Explanation
This sentence applies to many persons who would be able to identify themselves with the statement about being ambitious and reflective of one's own work. Most persons feel a sense of inadequacy on their side, but they feel satisfied about the work they have done, and the statement is thus pretty much relatable.

Why it Triggered the Barnum Effect: Self-doubt and pride are common emotional dualities. Anyone, no matter what his or her particular circumstance might be, is probably going to find elements of truth in the statement. The vagueness allows one to project their personal experiences onto the statement and drives the belief of the ad carrying the imprimatur of truth regarding how it describes them.
Sentence 3: ""You sometimes worry about the future, but you also tend to be optimistic about what lies ahead.""
Explanation
This sentence portrays the state of anxiety together with hope-the two major feelings that most people's lives are characterized. It appeals to the duality of human emotion, whereby most people come to experience opposite sentiments about their futures.

Why it Elicits the Barnum Effect: What most people have felt at one point or another, either anxious or hopeful, makes this sentence ring so true to a great many people. This is the vague gist of the statement that allows one to cling to the parts that apply to what's going on in their life and feel that it is describing them specifically.
Sentence 4: ""You have such a unique view of things that sometimes makes you feel no one really gets you.""
Explanation
This saying does well with the concept of individuality and the feeling of being an outsider, with most people being able to put their hand on their chest and say they can connect with it at some point. The phrase ""unique perspective"" does sound appealing and people like being unique or different.

Why it triggers the Barnum Effect: The vagueness of ""unique way of looking at things"" makes it easy to interpret broadly. Individuals tend to feel that they have experiences fitting the description of being misunderstood, especially in a society that is often geared towards fitting in. This perceived truth can make them believe that the statement was made for them.
Sentence 5: ""You tend to have introverted and extroverted tendencies that can make social engagements both fun and draining.""
Explanation
This statement falls under a common personality characteristic being termed an ambivert. So many people identify with it. It captures a complex perspective about the nature of social engagements and the fluctuations in energy associated with it, hence its wide applicability.

Why It Evokes the Barnum Effect: The claim of being simultaneously introverted and extroverted sometimes appeals to many in the population since most individuals identify with some of the characteristics in each label. The ambiguity of the term ""mix"" is such that everyone can derive something from it according to their situation, which enables them to identify with it in the context of their lives.
How the Barnum Effect Works
To understand why such sentences bring about the Barnum effect, it requires a deeper insight into psychological mechanisms. Some of the factors through which it contributes follow below:

Vagueness and Ambiguity: Every sentence is worded to avoid specifying in any way. This means that a person can consider himself to attribute these statements to himself because of their vagueness. In other words, almost anybody will find something descriptive in the text because of the indefinite nature of every sentence.

General Human Experiences: The statements are a touchstone for almost all of the general human experiences and emotions. Concepts such as acceptance, achievement, concern, and individuality characterise nearly everybody; therefore, the more likely that the reader will identify with their descriptions.

Desire to be validated; everyone wants to be listened to and validated. With such claims as these, persons appear to want to assent to the truth of them, especially if they seem to declare an experience or feeling. Need for validation creates a tendency to overlook the broad nature of the statements.

Cognitive Dissonance: When they are shown evidence that they really want to believe, people can suffer from cognitive dissonance. They may then try to resolve this dissonance by merely ignoring inconvenient evidence against their self-image and highlighting evidence that confirms it.

Self-Reflection: The reflection to these statements in general would tend to make the people reflective about themselves. Such reflection makes people even more liable to believe in the vague assertions, thereby enhancing their perception that indeed the statements might be correct.",10,"The student's answer effectively provides 5 sentences that induce the Barnum effect, each accompanied by a clear explanation of why it would induce the effect.

""You have vast, yet unused potentialities which, when unleashed, will let you tap into your road to success in ventures that truly matter to you.""

This sentence appeals to a universal desire of mankind or people to believe in their untapped potentiality. Almost everyone believes they have some unused capacity or scope for growth/success. That makes it very broad and easy to believe.
""At times, you find yourself needing both independence and closeness with others, which can create moments of internal conflict.""

Most people have experienced balance between experiencing the need for personal freedom and that of finding connection with other people. This duality is so common that most people can identify with it.
""You've experienced difficulties in your life, and even though you've become stronger, there are times when you still question the decisions that you make.""

Everyone has faced struggles, and the idea that one is an idiot to have conquered such problems is something that transcends humanity. The quote sounds personal, but it practically fits almost everybody.
""You are a compassionate person, but you don't always show it because you're afraid of being taken advantage of.""

Many consider themselves nice, gentle or empathetic but fear being too soft. The sentence evokes this familiarity and sense that it has been spoken just to you.
""You are a fair person who wants everyone to be fair with you sometimes, too.""

Nearly everyone has ever been subjected to treatment they feel is not just. Such a generic claim attaches itself to a reader's definition of fairness and injustices, rendering the claim entirely believable .
Why These Sentences are Likely to Evince the Barnum Effect
These sentences are worded such that they appear personal and particular, but actually are vague, and apply to millions of people. They work because they touch general experiences, like a lack of confidence, a desire to be successful, and feelings of compassion or fairness, that most everyone has felt at one time or another. By touching these common traits and feelings, the reader feels that the statements uniquely apply to them, though they are very broadly relatable. This is the heart of the Barnum Effect where individuals believe generic information specifically focuses on them.

Context: My friend Lilly decided to embark on a health journey after reading a popular wellness book that emphasized the benefits of a particular diet high on fats and low on carbohydrates.As she was inspired, she committed to this diet wholeheartedly.

Confirmation Bias: As Lilly followed her new dietary schedule, she sought out information that reinforced her choice, joining online communities and following influencers who championed the same diet. She carefully gathered her reading materials, focusing on articles and studies that extolled the virtues of low-carb, high-fat eating while disregarding research indicating potential health risks, such as increased cholesterol levels or nutrient deficiencies. Whenever someone raised concerns about the diet, Lilly would quickly dismiss their opinions, claiming they were misinformed or biased. Her confirmation bias led her to overlook the necessity of balanced nutrition, believing she had found the ultimate solution to health and weight management. She began to feel superior about her choices, often debating and brushing off others about the benefits of her diet.

Result: As months passed by, while Lilly initially lost weight and felt energized, she started experiencing fatigue and digestive issues. A routine check-up revealed elevated cholesterol levels, alarming her doctor. Upon further reflection, Lilly recognized that her strict practice of the diet had led her to neglect other important food groups, causing imbalances in her nutrition.

Confirmation bias: Markus spent most of his time researching social media success stories while neglecting other marketing channels. He actively sorted out data that supported his approach and often dismissed feedback from team members who suggested a more wider and diverse marketing strategy, including email campaigns and traditional advertising. When confronted with data showing diminishing returns from social media ads in certain demographics, he would argue that those cases were outliers or irrelevant to their specific target audience.

Result: The campaign launched under Markus's leadership fell flat, failing to meet the projected goals. The narrow focus on social media limited their reach, and the campaign did not resonate with a significant portion of their audience.

**1. Political Beliefs and News Consumption**

*Situation:* I’ve always been passionate about my political views and tend to read articles and watch news channels that align with my beliefs. A close friend, who shares my political stance, often posts articles on social media that reinforce our views. One day, I came across an article with a headline that perfectly matched my beliefs, and I eagerly shared it without thoroughly checking its validity. I felt a rush of validation and satisfaction as I posted it.

*How Confirmation Bias Occurred:* In this situation, confirmation bias took hold because I was actively seeking out and valuing information that supported my existing beliefs. I didn’t challenge or consider opposing viewpoints and was more inclined to embrace information that confirmed my stance.

*Result of Confirmation Bias:* The result of this bias was that my views became even more entrenched. I found myself more isolated in my opinions, which led to strained relationships with friends who had different perspectives. I was increasingly drawn into an echo chamber, which only deepened my polarization and reduced my openness to alternative viewpoints.

**2. Health Diagnosis and Internet Research**

*Situation:* I started experiencing some unusual symptoms and decided to do some online research. When I entered my symptoms into a search engine, I came across several articles suggesting they might be signs of a serious illness. I was particularly drawn to the articles that confirmed my fears. Despite lacking medical training, I began to convince myself that I was seriously ill and worried constantly.

*How Confirmation Bias Occurred:* My confirmation bias was evident here because I focused on information that aligned with my fears and anxieties. I paid close attention to sources that confirmed my worst-case scenario while ignoring or dismissing information that offered a less alarming perspective or suggested more benign explanations.

*Result of Confirmation Bias:* This led to heightened anxiety and stress, causing me to seek unnecessary medical tests and treatments. My belief in the worst-case scenario overshadowed a rational assessment of my health, which not only impacted my mental well-being but also strained my interactions with healthcare providers and loved ones. I found it challenging to find a balanced and accurate understanding of my condition.

Understanding confirmation bias has helped me realize the importance of seeking out diverse perspectives and questioning my assumptions. By being aware of this bias, I can make more informed and rational decisions, leading to healthier relationships and a more nuanced understanding of complex issues.",10,"The student's answer provides two clear and relevant situations where confirmation bias occurred.

If someone feels like a paticular investment like a stock or a piece of real estate is a good investment. He would tend to believe news channels and articles that confirm his initial belief of that particular stock being a good investment and he tends to ignore the channels and articles that say that it is not a good investment. As a result of this confirmational bias, he is likely to ignore the negatives and buy the stock and could end up in a loss.

**Specific Situation:** A friend of mine was experiencing persistent headaches and found some online information about a rare neurological condition that matched her symptoms. She became convinced that she had this condition, despite the fact that her symptoms could be explained by more common causes, like stress or eye strain.

**How Confirmation Bias Occurred:** My friend exhibited confirmation bias by selectively focusing on information that supported her belief that she had the rare condition. She avoided or downplayed information that suggested her symptoms could be attributed to more common and less severe conditions. For example, she ignored articles and advice from medical professionals that pointed to stress or fatigue as more probable causes of her headaches.

**Result of Confirmation Bias:** As a result of this bias, my friend became anxious and sought multiple opinions from specialists, focusing only on those who seemed to support her initial belief. This led to unnecessary stress, time, and financial expenditure. Ultimately, her headaches were diagnosed as being due to tension and lack of sleep, but her confirmation bias had caused significant distress and delayed her receiving appropriate and straightforward treatment.

### Situation 2: Political Beliefs

**Specific Situation:** During an election campaign, a colleague of mine strongly supported a particular political candidate. She only consumed news and information from sources that aligned with her candidate's views and frequently dismissed or criticized information from opposing sources as biased or inaccurate.

**How Confirmation Bias Occurred:** My colleague displayed confirmation bias by seeking out and favoring information that reinforced her preexisting political beliefs. She actively avoided media outlets and discussions that presented viewpoints contrary to her candidate’s policies or achievements. This selective exposure to information made her believe that her candidate was unquestionably the best choice, despite evidence of controversies or flaws.

**Result of Confirmation Bias:** The result of this bias was that my colleague had a skewed perception of the candidate and the election. She was less open to considering alternative viewpoints and was less informed about the full spectrum of political issues and candidates. This not only affected her ability to make a well-rounded decision but also contributed to heightened polarization and conflict in her political discussions. Her narrow focus on confirming her beliefs prevented her from engaging in more balanced and informed political discourse.

In both situations, confirmation bias led to a narrow and distorted understanding of the issues at hand, causing unnecessary stress and missed opportunities for more balanced perspectives and solutions. Recognizing and addressing confirmation bias is important to ensure a more accurate and comprehensive view of information and to make better-informed decisions.",10,The answer is comprehensive and provides two relevant situations where confirmation bias occurred.

A friend was considering investing in a new tech startup. They were excited about the company and believed it had immense potential. To make an informed decision, they decided to research the company's prospects. Instead of objectively evaluating all available information, my friend primarily focused on articles and reports that supported their positive view of the company. They sought out success stories, optimistic projections, and testimonials from people who were bullish on the startup. When they encountered negative information or concerns, they dismissed them as irrelevant or overly pessimistic. Because they only paid attention to the positive aspects, my friend decided to invest a significant amount of money in the startup. Unfortunately, the company faced unforeseen challenges and ultimately underperformed, leading to substantial financial losses. Had they considered the negative information more seriously, they might have made a more cautious investment or diversified their portfolio.

***Case 2:***

A doctor was diagnosing a patient who came in with common flu-like symptoms: fever, body aches, and fatigue. The doctor had recently seen a number of patients with the flu and assumed this patient had the same condition. Because the doctor was already convinced that the patient had the flu, they focused on symptoms and test results that confirmed this assumption. Even when the patient mentioned other symptoms that didn’t align with the flu, such as a persistent rash and unusual joint pain, the doctor dismissed these as unrelated. The doctor ordered a flu test but didn’t consider other possible diagnoses.The flu test came back negative, but instead of re-evaluating the situation, the doctor assumed it was a false negative and prescribed treatment for the flu anyway. Later, it was discovered that the patient actually had Lyme disease, a condition that could have been diagnosed earlier if the doctor had considered the full range of symptoms rather than focusing on confirming their initial assumption. The delay in proper diagnosis led to more severe symptoms and a longer recovery time for the patient.

During World War 2, the Imperial Japanese Army, sent a company of troops to fight against the US Military forces in the islands of Philippines. Sadly, the WW2 resulted in the defeat of the Imperial Japanese Empire and the surrender of the Japanese Emperor.  A Japanese soldier named *Hiroo Onoda*, continued to fight the war in one of the islands of Philippines for the Japanese Emperor even after the war was over as they were totally unaware of the happenings around the world. Ultimately all his fellow soldiers died due to war and  deadly diseases, but this man continued to fight a guerilla war with the localites of the island whom he had mistaken to be the ""Allies"". 

It was after this news that the Japanese and the US goverment undertook an operation to retrieve many of these WW2 soldiers from various remote islands where these soldiers have been fighting a void war for years. They did save many soldiers from various parts of the world by advertising about the completion of the war, sending aircrafts with people proclaiming it over all the remoted islands, spreading leaflets in the air with a note on it, and much more.

But our hero, Hiroo Onoda, was not to believe in any of this. Though he was the only one alive from his troop, he was ready to fight and suffer his entire life on the stranded island than to believe that the war was over. He confirmed again and again that it was a conspiracy used by the enemies to find the hiding place of the Japanese army and then take them over. So, despite all these efforts put in by both the governments, Hiroo Onoda never returned back from a long-forgotten war for decades just because he wasn't ready to let go his opinion.

Case 2:

One of my friends, who had studied with me back in my boarding school, was very specific about certain things in our day to day lives. He always wanted only certain set of scenarios to occur, only in certain way an object should be placed, only in certain way we are supposed to act and what not. He always emphasised on this, which, though good at times, still was totally absurd and pointless in many cases. What was more amusing was that he never ended with the 'HOWs', he even had a 'WHY' for all of it. Yet again, most ot them, to be serious, all of them were very peculiar and totally illogical. He kept on believing on his idea of lifestyle and their reasons but then none of us would accept. He was never to change his thinking because he strongly believed in them.

But sadly, not long ago, while having a general counselling class, we said about his ideas to our counsellor, who later had a personal session with him. It was later confirmed that he had OCD and this is the way people with OCD often behave. Now he's trying to treatit and let go of this habit.

* Situation: I was studying for an exam and I was convinced that I understood the material.

* Confirmation Bias: I only revised the parts I was confident about, ignoring the areas I struggled in. I dismissed feedback and correction from my friends because I was confident that I knew everything.

* Result: I scored less marks in the exam because the questions I didn't focus on during my revision were the questions that came in the exam so I was not able to answer them. This affected my overall grade.

* Situation: I recently purchased a new smartphone and was initially thrilled with my purchase.

* Confirmation Bias:I sought out reviews that praised the phone's features and capabilities. I dismissed any negative reviews. When I encountered minor issues or incovniences, I convinced myself that they were insignificant and could be  easily resolved.

* Result: My confirmation Bias prevented me from objectively evaluating the phones shortcomings.

-
I was preparing for a big exam and was convinced that one particular textbook was the best source of information. I had used this book in the past with good results, so I believed it would cover everything I needed for the exam. Even when friends and teachers suggested other resources, I stuck with my textbook, thinking it was the best choice.

**Confirmation Bias:** I focused entirely on this textbook, not using any other materials and advice. I assumed that anything not well covered in my chosen book wouldn’t be important for the exam at all.

**Result:** When the exam came, I found questions on topics that my textbook had barely touched. I struggled with those, and my score wasn’t as good as I expected it to be. Looking back, I realized that my reliance on one source, driven by confirmation bias, had limited my preparation.

Situation 3: Deciding Which Subjects Are ""Easy"" or ""Hard""
-

At the start of the school year, I had already decided that physics was a hard subject for me, based on my past experiences. I believed that no matter how much I studied, I would always struggle with physics. On the other hand, I thought chemistry was easy, and I didn’t need to put in as much effort to do well in it.

Confirmation Bias: Throughout the year, whenever I faced a difficult numerical in physics, I would think, ""See, physics is hard for me,"" and this would discourage me from trying different approaches. On the other hand, if I did well on a chemistry test , I would take it as proof that Chemistry was just easy, and I didn’t need to study as much.

Result: Because of this mindset, I ended up spending less time on physics, which made it harder for me to improve. I also didn’t push myself in Chemistry because I assumed I was already good at it. In the end, my grades reflected this, and I realized that my initial beliefs, reinforced by confirmation bias, had affected how much effort I put into both subjects.",10,The answer provides two relevant situations clearly demonstrating confirmation bias.

**1. Health Diagnosis**
   - **Situation**: A person who is deeply concerned about their health reads online articles about various health conditions, focusing specifically on symptoms they have experienced. They are convinced they might have a serious condition like fibromyalgia.
   - **How Confirmation Bias Occurred**: The person selectively searches for and pays more attention to information that supports their concern (i.e., symptoms matching their experiences), while ignoring or undervaluing evidence that suggests their symptoms are benign or caused by less serious conditions.
   - **Result**: This confirmation bias leads them to become increasingly anxious and may result in seeking unnecessary medical tests or treatments. The person might also overlook advice from healthcare professionals that contradicts their belief, potentially leading to stress and misguided health decisions.

**2. Political Beliefs**
   - **Situation**: An individual strongly supports a particular political party and regularly consumes news from sources that align with their views. During an election period, they focus on articles and reports that criticize the opposing party while dismissing any positive news or valid criticisms of their own party.
   - **How Confirmation Bias Occurred**: The individual selectively exposes themselves to information that reinforces their existing political beliefs and actively avoids or discredits information that might challenge their views. This creates a skewed perception of political events and candidates.
   - **Result**: This confirmation bias reinforces the individual's existing beliefs, deepens political polarization, and reduces their ability to critically evaluate the policies and actions of all political parties. It can lead to a less informed electorate and increased divisiveness.

### Importance of Recognizing Confirmation Bias

**1. Promotes Balanced Decision-Making**
   - Recognizing confirmation bias is crucial for making well-rounded decisions. By being aware of this bias, individuals can seek out diverse perspectives and evidence, leading to more informed and objective choices.

**2. Enhances Critical Thinking**
   - Understanding confirmation bias helps individuals develop critical thinking skills. It encourages questioning assumptions, evaluating evidence impartially, and avoiding the pitfalls of selective perception.

**3. Reduces Conflict**
   - Awareness of confirmation bias can help mitigate conflicts that arise from entrenched beliefs. By acknowledging that everyone is susceptible to this bias, individuals can approach disagreements with a more open mind and seek common ground based on objective facts.

In summary, recognition and mitigation of confirmation bias are essential for fair decision-making, critical thinking, and reducing interpersonal and societal conflicts. It ensures a more balanced approach to evaluating information and making choices.",10,,"The assignment is plagiarized, kindly refrain from using AI and redo the assignment.",0,100.0,10

Imagine someone named Alex is looking to buy a new smartphone. Alex has a strong preference for Brand X because of positive past experiences and favorable reviews they’ve read. Alex decides to purchase a new model from Brand X.

How Confirmation Bias Occurred:
When Alex starts researching this new model, they focus only on positive reviews and testimonials that support their existing preference for Brand X. Alex deliberately avoids or dismisses any negative reviews or criticisms about the phone, even if they are credible. They also tend to interpret ambiguous information in a way that reinforces their positive view of Brand X.

Result of Confirmation Bias:
Alex ends up buying the new smartphone from Brand X, but soon discovers that it has several issues that were mentioned in the negative reviews they ignored. The phone has poor battery life and a less responsive touchscreen than expected. Alex’s confirmation bias led them to overlook important information that might have prevented an unsatisfactory purchase.

Situation 2: Health and Wellness Trends
Situation:
Consider Sarah, who is very interested in holistic health and wellness. She follows a particular diet trend that emphasizes the benefits of detox cleanses. Sarah is enthusiastic about the positive effects claimed by supporters of this diet.

How Confirmation Bias Occurred:
Sarah actively seeks out articles, social media posts, and testimonials that praise the detox cleanse and its benefits. She avoids or discredits scientific studies or expert opinions that question the efficacy of the cleanse or highlight potential risks. Sarah’s belief in the detox cleanse is reinforced by the selective information she chooses to consume.

Result of Confirmation Bias:
Despite following the detox cleanse, Sarah experiences some adverse health effects such as fatigue and digestive issues. Her confirmation bias prevented her from considering valid medical advice and evidence that might have guided her toward a more balanced and scientifically supported approach to health. This resulted in a potentially avoidable negative impact on her well-being.",10,Good.,,10,100.0,10
